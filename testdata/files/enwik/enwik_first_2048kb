      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Anarchism}}
'''Anarchism''' originated as a term of abuse first used against early [[working class]] [[radical]]s including the [[Diggers]] of the [[English Revolution]] and the [[sans-culotte|''sans-culottes'']] of the [[French Revolution]].[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html] Whilst the term is still used in a pejorative way to describe ''&quot;any act that used violent means to destroy the organization of society&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zhistorintpolency.html History of International Police Cooperation], from the final protocols of the &quot;International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists&quot;, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;, it has also been taken up as a positive label by self-defined anarchists.

The word '''anarchism''' is [[etymology|derived from]] the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[Wiktionary:&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;|&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;]]'' (&quot;without [[archon]]s (ruler, chief, king)&quot;). Anarchism as a [[political philosophy]], is the belief that ''rulers'' are unnecessary and should be abolished, although there are differing interpretations of what this means. Anarchism also refers to related [[social movement]]s) that advocate the elimination of authoritarian institutions, particularly the [[state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Definitions_of_anarchism Definitions of anarchism] on Wikiquote, accessed 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;[[anarchy]],&quot; as most anarchists use it, does not imply [[chaos]], [[nihilism]], or [[anomie]], but rather a harmonious [[anti-authoritarian]] society. In place of what are regarded as authoritarian political structures and coercive economic institutions, anarchists advocate social relations based upon [[voluntary association]] of autonomous individuals, [[mutual aid]], and [[self-governance]]. 
    
While anarchism is most easily defined by what it is against, anarchists also offer positive visions of what they believe to be a truly free society. However, ideas about how an anarchist society might work vary considerably, especially with respect to economics; there is also disagreement about how a free society might be brought about. 

== Origins and predecessors ==

[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], and others, argue that before recorded [[history]], human society was organized on anarchist principles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], Peter. ''&quot;[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]&quot;'', 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; Most anthropologists follow Kropotkin and Engels in believing that hunter-gatherer bands were egalitarian and lacked division of labour, accumulated wealth, or decreed law, and had equal access to resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], Freidrich. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]&quot;'', 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|William Godwin]]

Anarchists including the [[The Anarchy Organisation]] and [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]] find anarchist attitudes in [[Taoism]] from [[History of China|Ancient China]].&lt;ref&gt;The Anarchy Organization (Toronto). ''Taoism and Anarchy.'' [[April 14]] [[2002]] [http://www.toxicpop.co.uk/library/taoism.htm Toxicpop mirror] [http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/5705/taoan.html Vanity site mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]], Murray. ''&quot;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ancient-chinese.html The Ancient Chinese Libertarian Tradition]&quot;'', an extract from ''&quot;[http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/9_2/9_2_3.pdf Concepts of the Role of Intellectuals in Social Change Toward Laissez Faire]&quot;'', The Journal of Libertarian Studies, 9 (2) Fall 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]] found similar ideas in [[stoicism|stoic]] [[Zeno of Citium]]. According to Kropotkin, Zeno &quot;repudiated the omnipotence of the state, its intervention and regimentation, and proclaimed the sovereignty of the moral law of the individual&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html Anarchism], written by Peter Kropotkin, from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anabaptist]]s of 16th century Europe are sometimes considered to be religious forerunners of modern anarchism. [[Bertrand Russell]], in his ''History of Western Philosophy'', writes that the Anabaptists &quot;repudiated all law, since they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by [[the Holy Spirit]]...[f]rom this premise they arrive at [[communism]]....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], Bertrand. ''&quot;Ancient philosophy&quot;'' in ''A History of Western Philosophy, and its connection with political and social circumstances from the earliest times to the present day'', 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diggers (True Levellers)|The Diggers]] or &quot;True Levellers&quot; were an early communistic movement during the time of the [[English Civil War]], and are considered by some as forerunners of modern anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zpub.com/notes/aan-hist.html An Anarchist Timeline], from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[modern era]], the first to use the term to mean something other than chaos was [[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Louis-Armand, Baron de Lahontan]] in his ''Nouveaux voyages dans l'Amérique septentrionale'', (1703), where he described the [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous American]] society, which had no state, laws, prisons, priests, or private property, as being in anarchy&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-12 Dictionary of the History of Ideas - ANARCHISM]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Russell Means]], a [[libertarian]] and leader in the [[American Indian Movement]], has repeatedly stated that he is &quot;an anarchist, and so are all [his] ancestors.&quot;

In 1793, in the thick of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] published ''An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice'' [http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pjtp.html]. Although Godwin did not use the word ''anarchism'', many later anarchists have regarded this book as the first major anarchist text, and Godwin as the &quot;founder of philosophical anarchism.&quot; But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the term ''anarchiste'' was known mainly as an insult hurled by the [[bourgeois]] [[Girondins]] at more radical elements in the [[French revolution]].

==The first self-labelled anarchist==
[[Image:Pierre_Joseph_Proudhon.jpg|110px|thumb|left|Pierre Joseph Proudhon]]
{{main articles|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]}}

It is commonly held that it wasn't until [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] published ''[[What is Property?]]'' in 1840 that the term &quot;anarchist&quot; was adopted as a self-description. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. In [[What is Property?]] Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (propriété), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they wish, such as exploiting workers for profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property]&quot;'' from ''&quot;[[What is Property?]]&quot;'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called 'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources, capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice. 

Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]] (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in France.

Proudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|here]].''

==Max Stirner's Egoism==
{{main articles|[[Max Stirner]] and [[Egoism]]}}

In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists' only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.&quot;

Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label 'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his thought are diverse.

==American individualist anarchism==
[[Image:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Benjamin Tucker]]]]
{{main articles|[[Individualist anarchism]] and [[American individualist anarchism]]}}

In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]] experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)

[[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty'' from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]]; Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]] (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]]; and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;.  Tucker strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or her labour as &quot;[[private property]]&quot;, and believed in a &lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker|Tucker]], Benjamin. ''&quot;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/tucker/tucker37.htm Labor and Its Pay]&quot;'' Individual Liberty: Selections From the Writings of Benjamin R. Tucker, Vanguard Press, New York, 1926, Kraus Reprint Co., Millwood, NY, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;[[market economy]] for trading this property. He argued that in a truly free market system without the state, the abundance of  competition would eliminate profits and ensure that all workers received the full value of their labor. 

Other 19th century individualists included [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], and [[Victor Yarros]].

==The First International==
[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Bakunin|Mikhail Bakunin 1814-1876]]]]
{{main articles|[[International Workingmen's Association]], [[Anarchism and Marxism]]}}

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes called the 'First International', united some diverse European revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to active workers movements the International became signficiant. 

From the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International: he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.   The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers focused on parliamentary activity.

Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], Mikhail. ''&quot;[http://www.litencyc.com/php/adpage.php?id=1969 Statism and Anarchy]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]]. This is often cited as the origin of the [[Anarchist_objections_to_marxism|conflict between anarchists and Marxists]]. From this moment the ''[[Social democracy|social democratic]]'' and ''[[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]]'' currents of socialism had distinct organisations including rival [[List of left-wing internationals|'internationals'.]]

==Anarchist Communism==
{{main|Anarchist communism}}
[[Image:PeterKropotkin.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Peter Kropotkin]]

Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]

An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle - Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).

Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.

Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;

==Propaganda of the deed==
[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]
{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}

Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. 

One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  

However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).

Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].

==Anarchism in the labour movement==
{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}

[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.

After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.

The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.

[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]

Spanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].

Syndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].

Contemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  

The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].

Anarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.

==The Russian Revolution==
{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.

Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. 

The ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.

==The fight against fascism==
{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}
[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:

:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}

In France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. 

In reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.

Since the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''

==Religious anarchism==
[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]
{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}

Most anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.

[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.

Christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.

[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].

[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].

==Anarchism and feminism==
[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]
{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}

Early [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'Héricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.
 
Anarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}

Anarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  

Anarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.

In the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarcho-capitalism==
[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.

[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.

Some anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M. Ebeling, Editor), New York: The Center for Libertarian Studies, May 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;david-hart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico]], Ralph [http://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century''] Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee, Unité associée au CNRS (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of anarcho-capitalists dispute these claims.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Iain; Elkin, Gary; Neal, Dave ''et al'' [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append11.html Replies to Some Errors and Distortions in Bryan Caplan's &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; version 5.2] ''An Anarchist FAQ Version 11.2'' Accessed February 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of anarcho-capitalism within anarchism, and indeed whether it is a form of anarchism at all, is highly controversial. For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.

==Anarchism and the environment==
{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}

Since the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}

Primitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.

==Other branches and offshoots==
Anarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.

[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]
*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]

*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]

*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]

*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]

==Other issues==
*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]

*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.

*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.

*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.

*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism. Some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modulaware.com/a/?m=select&amp;id=0684832720 The Sovereign Individual -- Mastering the transition to the information age]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'': [[Crypto-anarchism]] and [[Cypherpunk]].

*'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy. [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.

*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).

*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''

==Criticisms of anarchism==
:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]

'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:
:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; 

'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.

'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural phenomena==
[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928–)]]
The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently élitist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:

* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]
* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]
* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] 
* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]
* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicolás Rosselló]]

In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   

In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression.

'''Autism''' is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction, communication ability, patterns of interests, and patterns of behavior. 

Although the specific [[etiology]] of autism is unknown, many researchers suspect that autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to environmental triggers. And while there is disagreement about the magnitude, nature, and mechanisms for such environmental factors, researchers have found at least seven major genes prevalent among individuals diagnosed as autistic. Some estimate that autism occurs in as many as one [[United States]] child in 166, however the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] gives a more conservative estimate of one in 1000{{ref|NihAutismov2005}}. For families that already have one autistic child, the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in twenty.  Diagnosis is based on a list of [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] criteria, and a series of standardized clinical tests may also be used.

Autism may not be [[Physiology|physiologically]] obvious. A complete physical and [[neurological]] evaluation will typically be part of diagnosing autism. Some now speculate that autism is not a single condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in similar ways.

By definition, autism must manifest delays in &quot;social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play,&quot; with &quot;onset prior to age 3 years&quot;, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]. The [[ICD-10]] also says that symptoms must &quot;manifest before the age of three years.&quot; There have been large increases in the reported [[Autism epidemic|incidence of autism]], for reasons that are heavily debated by [[research]]ers in [[psychology]] and related fields within the [[scientific community]].

Some children with autism have improved their social and other skills to the point where they can fully participate in mainstream education and social events, but there are lingering concerns that an absolute cure from autism is impossible with current technology. However, many autistic children and adults who are able to communicate (at least in writing) are opposed to attempts to cure their conditions, and see such conditions as part of who they are.

==History==
[[image:Asperger_kl2.jpg|frame|right|Dr. [[Hans Asperger]] described a form of autism in the 1940s that later became known as [[Asperger's syndrome]].]]

The word ''autism'' was first used in the [[English language]] by Swiss psychiatrist [[Eugene Bleuler]] in a 1912 number of the ''American Journal of Insanity''. It comes from the Greek word for &quot;self&quot;.

However, the [[Medical classification|classification]] of autism did not occur until the middle of the [[twentieth century]], when in 1943 psychiatrist Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in Baltimore reported on 11 child patients with striking behavioral similarities, and introduced the label ''early infantile autism''. He suggested &quot;autism&quot; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;alpha;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (''autos''), meaning &quot;self&quot;, to describe the  fact that the children seemed to lack interest in other people. Although Kanner's first paper on the subject was published in a (now defunct) journal, ''The Nervous Child'', almost every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.

At the same time an [[Austria|Austrian]] scientist, Dr. [[Hans Asperger]], described a different form of autism that became known as [[Asperger's syndrome]]&amp;mdash;but the widespread recognition of Asperger's work was delayed by [[World War II]] in [[Germany]], and by the fact that his seminal paper wasn't translated into English for almost 50 years. The majority of his work wasn't widely read until 1997.

Thus these two conditions were described and are today listed in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision 1) as two of the five [[Pervasive developmental disorder|pervasive developmental disorders]] (PDD), more often referred to today as [[Autistic spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD). All of these conditions are characterized by varying degrees of difference in [[communication skill]]s, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of [[Human behavior|behavior]].

Few clinicians today solely use the DSM-IV criteria for determining a diagnosis of autism, which are based on the absence or delay of certain developmental milestones. Many clinicians instead use an alternate means (or a combination thereof) to more accurately determine a [[diagnosis]].

==Terminology==
{{wiktionarypar2|autism|autistic}}
When referring to someone diagnosed with autism, the term ''autistic'' is often used. However, the term ''person with autism'' can be used instead. This is referred to as ''[[person-first terminology]]''. The [[autistic community]] generally prefers the term ''autistic'' for reasons that are fairly controversial. This article uses the term ''autistic'' (see [[Talk:Autism|talk page]]).

==Characteristics==
[[Image:kanner_kl2.jpg|frame|right|Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]
There is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals diagnosed as autistic, and physicians will often arrive at different conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis. Much of this is due to the [[sensory system]] of an autistic which is quite different from the sensory system of other people, since certain [[stimulus|stimulations]] can affect an autistic differently than a non-autistic, and the degree to which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic person to another.

Nevertheless, professionals within [[pediatric]] care and development often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment as early as possible.  However, some people do not believe in treatment for autism, either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe treatment can do more harm than good.

===Social development===
Typically, developing infants are social beings&amp;mdash;early in life they do such things as gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most autistic children prefer objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many seem indifferent to other people because they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as non-autistic children.

Children with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of [[anger]] or [[affection]] in a typical way. Research has suggested that although autistic children are attached to their [[parent]]s, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, [[teaching]], and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of expected [[attachment theory|attachment]] behavior.

Children with autism appear to lack &quot;[[Theory of mind|theory of mind]]&quot;, the ability to see things from another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher [[primate]]s such as adult [[gorilla]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobos]]. Typical 5-year-olds can develop insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures, facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions. The [[social alienation]] of autistic and Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have [[imaginary friend]]s as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic children. 

Although not universal, it is common for autistic people to not regulate their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that may seem out of proportion to the situation. Individuals with autism generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react negatively to changes in them. It is not uncommon for these individuals to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior, self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations.

===Sensory system===
A key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would include looking for symptoms much like those found in [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction|sensory integration dysfunction]]. Children will exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement.

One common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.

It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for ''autistic disorder''.

===Communication difficulties===
By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name, points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech development in people with autism takes different paths.  Some remain [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]] and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years.  Still, inability to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware.  Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s, discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].

Those who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or throughout their lives.  Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called [[echolalia]].  Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in.  Many people with autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often understand spoken language. 
Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]], but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s.  The &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things in people without autism.  In particular, autistic language abilities tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.

The body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the things that can lead to problems.

Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.

===Repetitive behaviors===
Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily routine.

===Effects in education===
Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student. Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings, they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them. They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught. 

Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. 

Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children. &lt;!-- cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom.

A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need. 

There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them.

Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety. Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control excessive behavioral reactions.

== DSM definition ==
Autism is defined in section 299.00 of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) as:
#A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2) and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3):

The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual''&lt;!-- --&gt;'s diagnostic criteria in general is controversial for being vague and subjective.  (See the [[DSM cautionary statement]].) The criteria for autism is much more controversial and some clinicians today may ignore it completely, instead solely relying on other methods for determining the diagnosis.

== Types of autism == 
Autism presents in a wide degree, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[Developmental Disability|mentally handicapped]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to appear unexceptional (&quot;normal&quot;) to the general public. In terms of both classification and therapy, autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high-functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to [[IQ]].  The terms low and high functioning are controversial and not all autistics accept these labels.  Further, these two labels are not currently used or accepted in autism literature.

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA. For example, some professionals refuse to recognize autistics who can speak or write as being autistic at all, because they still think of autism as a communication disorder so severe that no speech or writing is possible.

As a consequence, many &quot;high-functioning&quot; autistic persons, and autistic people with a relatively high [[IQ]], are underdiagnosed, thus making the claim that &quot;autism implies retardation&quot; self-fulfilling. The number of people diagnosed with LFA is not rising quite as sharply as HFA, indicating that at least part of the explanation for the apparent rise is probably better diagnostics.

=== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ===
[[Image:Hans Asperger.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Asperger described his patients as &quot;little professors&quot;.]]
In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder (Kanner's) and Asperger's syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome observes &quot;no clinically significant delay&quot; in these areas. {{ref|bnas}}

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Kanner's autism has produced a popular conception that ''[[Asperger's syndrome]]'' is synonymous with &quot;higher-functioning autism,&quot; or that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have Asperger's autism or that both types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label attached. Also, autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately depicted in ''[[Rain Man]]'' has encouraged relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as having Asperger's syndrome rather than autism.

===Autism as a spectrum disorder===
{{details|Autistic spectrum}}

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as [[autistic spectrum]] disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]], which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our senses.  Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

There are two main manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and often around 18 months.  Although this causes some controversy over when the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the disorder. This triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin that enters the mother's body and is transfered to the fetus. The triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the child's body.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==
{{details|Autism epidemic}}

[[Image:autismnocgraph.png|right|thumb|400px|The number of reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade. Statistics in graph from the [[National Center for Health Statistics]].]]
There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of increases in the diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple personality disorder]] in the twentieth century. This has brought rise to a number of different theories as to the nature of the sudden increase.

Epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the United States is partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria, reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the [[M.I.N.D. Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed that the increase in autism is real, even after those complicating factors are accounted for (see reference in this section below).

Other researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, &quot;There is a chance we're seeing a true rise, but right now I don't think anybody can answer that question for sure.&quot; ([[Newsweek]] reference below).

The answer to this question has significant ramifications on the direction of research, since a ''real increase'' would focus more attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors, while ''little or no real increase'' would focus more attention to genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular impact on people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little public research on the effects of [[in vitro fertilization]] on the number of incidences of autism.

One of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between &quot;geekdom&quot; and autism.  This is hinted, for instance, by a ''Wired Magazine'' article in 2001 entitled &quot;The [[Geek]] Syndrome&quot;, which is a point argued by many in the autism rights movement{{ref|Wired}}.  This article, many professionals assert, is just one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior&amp;mdash;they argue that shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism or Asperger's syndrome. Others assert that it is actually the medical profession which is applying mental disease labels to children who in the past would have simply been accepted as a little different or even labeled 'gifted'. See [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of this issue.

Due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses of high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in light of symptoms they currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their children's diagnoses. Because autism falls into the [[pervasive developmental disorder]] category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a [[differential diagnosis]].

== Therapies ==
{{details|Autism therapies}}

==Sociology==
Due to the complexity of autism, there are many facets of [[sociology]] that need to be considered when discussing it, such as the culture which has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one another.  In addition, there are several subgroups forming within the autistic community, sometimes in strong opposition to one another.

===Community and politics===
{{details|Autistic community}}
{{details|Autism rights movement}}

Much like many other controversies in the world, the autistic community itself has splintered off into several groups.  Essentially, these groups are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed ''pro-cure'', those who do not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it, dubbed ''anti-cure'', and the many people caught in the middle of the two.  In recent history, with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to a cure, some members of the &quot;anti-cure&quot; movement [[Autistic community#Declaration from the autism community|sent a letter to the United Nations]] demanding to be treated as a minority group rather than a group with a [[mental disability]] or disease. Websites such as  autistics.org{{ref|refbot.770}} present the view of the anti-cure group.

There are numerous resources available for autistics from many groups.  Due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to communicate online than in person, many of these resources are available online.  In addition, sometimes successful autistic adults in a local community will help out children with autism, much in the way a master would help out an apprentice, for example.

2002 was declared [[Autism Awareness Year]] in the [[United Kingdom]]&amp;mdash;this idea was initiated by [[Ivan and Charika Corea]], parents of an autistic child, Charin. Autism Awareness Year was led by the [[British Institute of Brain Injured Children]],  [[Disabilities Trust]],  [[National Autistic Society]],  [[Autism London]] and 800 organizations in the United Kingdom. It had the personal backing of [[United Kingdom|British]] Prime Minister  [[Tony Blair]] and parliamentarians of all parties in the [[Palace of Westminster]].

===Culture===
{{details|Autistic culture}}
With the recent increases in autism recognition and new approaches to educating and socializing autistics, an ''autistic culture'' has begun to develop.  Similar to [[deaf culture]], autistic culture is based in a belief that autism is a unique way of being and not a disorder to be cured.  There are some commonalities which are specific to autism in general as a culture, not just &quot;autistic culture&quot;.

It is a common misperception that people with autism do not marry; many do get married.  Often, they marry another person with autism, although this is not always the case.  Many times autistics are attracted to other autistics due to shared interests or obsessions, but more often than not the attraction is due to simple compatibility with personality types, the same as is true for non-autistics. Autistics who communicate have explained that companionship is as important to autistics as it is to anyone else. Multigenerational autistic families have also recently become a bit more common.

The interests of autistic people and so-called &quot;[[geeks]]&quot; or &quot;[[Nerd|nerds]]&quot; can often overlap as autistic people can sometimes become preoccupied with certain subjects, much like the variant normal behavior geeks experience.  However, in practice many autistic people have difficulty with working in groups, which impairs them even in the most &quot;technical&quot; of situations.

===Autistic adults===
[[image:Grandin2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Temple Grandin]], one of the more successful adults with autism.

Some autistic adults are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs, usually those with high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. Nevertheless, communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of the autistic's life. Other autistics are capable of employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities. A nurturing environment at home, at school, and later in job training and at work, helps autistic people continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives. Some argue that the internet allows autistic individuals to communicate and form online communities, in addition to being able to find occupations such as independent consulting, which does generally not require much human interaction offline.

In the [[United States]], the public schools' responsibility for providing services ends when the autistic person is in their 20s, depending on each state. The family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of their adult child, as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals.

=== Autistic savants ===
{{Main|autistic savant}}
The autistic savant phenomenon is sometimes seen in autistic people. The term is used to describe a person who is autistic and has extreme talent in a certain area of study.  Although there is a common association between savants and autism (an association created by the 1988 film ''[[Rain Man]]''), most autistic people are not [[savants]]. [[Mental calculator]]s and fast [[programming]] skills are the most common form. The famous example is [[Daniel Tammet]], the subject of the [[documentary film]] ''[[The Brain Man]]'' {{ref|guardianbrainman}} ([[Kim Peek]], one of the inspirations for [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s character in the film ''[[Rain Man]]'', is not autistic). &quot;Bright Splinters of the Mind&quot; is a book that explores this issue further.

== Other pervasive developmental disorders ==
Autism and Asperger's syndrome are just two of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). The three other pervasive developmental disorders are [[Rett syndrome]], [[Childhood disintegrative disorder]], and [[PDD not otherwise specified|Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]]. Some of these are related to autism, while some of them are entirely separate conditions.

=== Rett syndrome ===
[[Rett syndrome]] is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses; she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of these early symptoms may be confused for autism. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. [[Physical therapy|Physical]], [[Occupational therapy|occupational]], and [[Speech therapy|speech]] therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and [[speech]].

Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene causes Rett syndrome, and can physically test for it with a 80% accuracy rate {{ref|nihrett}}. Rett syndrome in the past was sometimes classified as an autistic spectrum disorder, however most scientists agree that Rett syndrome is a separate developmental disorder and not part of the autistic spectrum {{ref|brighttotsrett}}.

===Childhood disintegrative disorder===
[[Childhood disintegrative disorder]] (CDD, and sometimes abbreviated as CHDD also) is a condition appearing in 3 or 4 year old children who have developed normally until age 2. Over several months, the child will deteriorate in intellectual, social, and language functioning from previously normal behaviour.  This long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome (and in fact it must be differentiated from autism in testing). The cause for CDD is unknown (thus it may be a spectrum disorder) but current evidence suggests it has something to do with the central nervous system {{ref|yalecdd}} {{ref|nihcdd}}.

===  Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified ===
[[PDD not otherwise specified|Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]], or PDD-NOS, is referred to as a ''subthreshold'' condition because it is a classification which is given to someone who suffers from impairments in social interaction, communication, and/or stereotyped behaviour but does not meet the criteria for one of the other four pervasive developmental disorders. Unlike the other four pervasive developmental disorders, PDD-NOS has no specific guidelines for diagnosis, so the person may have a lot of characteristics of an autistic person, or few to none at all. Note that pervasive developmental disorder is not a diagnosis, just a term to refer to the five mentioned conditions, while PDD-NOS is an official diagnosis {{ref|yalepddnos}}.

'''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar radiation]] is greater.

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored building materials so the structures will remain cooler.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -150 °C (-240 °F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 °C (9 °F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]], &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.

Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a local 1 &amp;deg;C increase in the daily temperature range (the difference of day and night temperatures) (''see: [[contrail]]'').

=== Aerosol effects ===

[[Particulate|Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCN]]s and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is less certain [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671].

=== Black carbon ===

Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[IPCC]] say that their &quot;estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols from fossil fuels is ... +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; (from +0.1 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[SAR_(IPCC)|SAR)]]) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;.

'''Abu Dhabi''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: &amp;#1571;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1608; &amp;#1592;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1610; ''&amp;#700;Ab&amp;#363; &amp;#7826;aby'') is the largest of the seven [[emirate]]s that comprise the [[United Arab Emirates]] and was also the largest of the former [[Trucial States]]. '''Abu Dhabi''' is also a city of the same name within the Emirate that is the [[capital city|capital]] of the country, in north central UAE.  The city lies on a T-shaped island jutting into the [[Persian Gulf]] from the central western coast. An estimated 1,000,000 lived there in 2000, with about an 80% [[expatriate]] population. Abu Dhabi city is located at {{coor d|24.4667|N|54.3667|E}}. [[Al Ain]] is Abu Dhabi's second largest urban area with a population of 348,000 ([[2003]] census estimate) and is located 150 kilometres inland.
 
==History==
Parts of Abu Dhabi were settled as far back as the [[3rd millennium BC]] and its early history fits the nomadic, herding and fishing pattern typical of the broader region. Modern Abu Dhabi traces its origins to the rise of an important tribal confederation the Bani Yas in the late 18th century, who also assumed control of [[Dubai]]. In the 19th century the Dubai and Abu Dhabi branches parted ways.

Into the mid-20th century, the economy of Abu Dhabi continued to be sustained mainly by camel herding, production of dates and vegetables at the inland oases of [[Al Ain]] and Liwa, and fishing and pearl diving off the coast of Abu Dhabi city, which was occupied mainly during the summer months.  Most dwellings in Abu Dhabi city were, at this time constructed of palm fronds (barasti), with the better-off families occupying mud huts.  The growth of the cultured pearl industry in the first half of the 20th century created hardship for residents of Abu Dhabi as pearls represented the largest export and main source of cash earnings.  

In 1939, Sheikh [[Shakhbut Bin-Sultan Al Nahyan]] granted [[Petroleum]] concessions, and oil was first found in 1958.  At first, oil money had a marginal impact.  A few lowrise concete buildings were erected, and the first paved road was completed in 1961, but Sheikh Shakbut, uncertain whether the new oil royalties would last, took a cautious approach, prefering to save the revenue rather than investing it in development.  His brother, [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahayan]], saw that oil wealth had the potential to transform Abu Dhabi.  The ruling Al Nahayan family decided that Sheikh Zayed should replace his brother as Ruler and carry out his vision of developing the country.  On [[August 6]], [[1966]], with the assistance of the British, Sheikh Zayed became the new ruler.  See generally, Al-Fahim, M, ''From Rags to Riches: A Story of Abu Dhabi'', Chapter Six (London Centre of Arab Studies, 1995), ISBN 1 900404 00 1.

With the announcement by Britain in 1968 that it would withdraw from the Gulf area by 1971, Sheikh Zayed became the main driving force behind the formation of the [[United Arab Emirates]].

After the Emirates gained independence in 1971, oil wealth continued to flow to the area and traditional [[Mudbrick|mud-brick]] [[hut]]s were rapidly replaced with [[banks]], boutiques and modern [[highrise]]s.

==Current ruler==
His Highness Sheikh [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahayan]] is the hereditary [[Emir|emir]] and ruler of Abu Dhabi, as well as the current president of the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).

==Postal History==
[[Image:Stamp_Abu_1967_40f-170px.jpg|right|170px|thumb|[[Shaikh]] [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahayan|Zaid]], [[1967]].]]
Now part of the [[United Arab Emirates]], '''Abu Dhabi''' was formerly the largest of the seven sheikdoms which made up the [[Trucial States]] on the so-called [[Pirate Coast]] of eastern [[Arabia]] between [[Oman]] and [[Qatar]].  The [[Trucial States]] as a whole had an area of some 32,000 square miles of which Abu Dhabi alone had 26,000.  The capital was the town of Abu Dhabi which is on an offshore island and was first settled in 1761.

The name [[Trucial States]] arose from [[treaties]] made with [[Great Britain]] in 1820 which ensured a condition of [[truce]] in the area and the suppression of [[piracy]] and [[slavery]].  The [[treaty]] expired on [[31 December]] [[1966]].  The decision to form the [[UAE]] was made on [[18 July]] [[1971]] and the [[federation]] was founded on [[1 August]] [[1972]], although the inaugural [[UAE]] stamps were not issued until [[1 January]] [[1973]].

[[petroleum|Oil]] production began on [[Das Island]] after [[prospecting]] during 1956-1960.  [[Das Island]] is part of Abu Dhabi but lies well [[offshore]], about 100 miles north of the mainland.  [[petroleum|Oil]] production on the [[mainland]] began in 1962.  As a major [[petroleum|oil]] producer, Abu Dhabi soon acquired massive [[financial]] wealth.  [[Investment]] in long-term [[construction]] projects and the establishment of a [[finance]] sector has led to the area becoming a centre of [[commerce]] which may well secure its lasting importance when the [[petroleum|oil]] resources are exhausted.

In December 1960, [[postage stamps]] of [[Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Brit - British)#British Postal Agencies in Eastern Arabia|British Postal Agencies in Eastern Arabia]] were supplied to the [[construction]] workers on [[Das Island]] but the [[postal service]] was administered via the agency office in [[Bahrain]].  The [[mail]] was also [[postmark]]ed [[Bahrain]] so there was no clear indication that a [[letter]] had come from [[Das Island]].

On [[30 March]] [[1963]], a British agency was opened in Abu Dhabi and issued the agency stamps after the sheik objected to the use of the [[Trucial States]] [[definitive]]s.  [[Mail]] from [[Das Island]] continued to be administered by [[Bahrain]] but was now cancelled by an Abu Dhabi [[Trucial States]] [[postmark]].

The first Abu Dhabi stamps were a [[definitive series]] of [[30 March]] [[1964]] depicting [[Shaikh]] [[Shakhbut Bin-Sultan Al Nahyan]].  There were eleven values under the [[India|Indian]] [[currency]] that was used of 100 [[paisa|naye paise]] = 1 [[rupee]].  The range of values was 5 np to 10 [[rupee]]s.  Despite the introduction of these [[definitive]]s, the British agency stamps remained valid in both Abu Dhabi and [[Das Island]] until the end of 1966 when they were withdrawn.

A [[post office]] was opened on [[Das Island]] on [[6 January]] [[1966]] and this ended the [[Bahrain]] service.  [[Mail]] from [[Das Island]] was now handled within Abu Dhabi.

When the [[treaty]] with [[Great Britain]] expired at the end of 1966, Abu Dhabi introduced a new [[currency]] of 1000 [[fils]] = 1 [[dinar]] and took over its own postal administration, including the [[Das Island]] office. The earlier issues were subject to [[surcharge]]s in this [[currency]] and replacement [[definitive]]s were released depicting the new ruler [[Shaikh]] [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahayan|Zaid]].  Issues continued until introduction of [[UAE]] stamps in 1973.

In all, Abu Dhabi issued 95 stamps from 1964 to 1972, the final set being three views of the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]].

==Climate==
Sunny/blue skies can be expected through-out the year. The months June through September are generally hot and humid with temperatures averaging above 40ºC(110ºF). The weather is usually pleasant from October to May. January to February is cooler and may require the use of a light jacket. The oasis city of [[Al Ain]] enjoys cooler temperatures even through summer due to [[sporadic]] rainfall.

==Transport==
[[Abu Dhabi International Airport]] serves this city. The local time is [[GMT]] + 4 hours.

==Trivia==
* The cartoon cat [[Garfield]] would often put the kitten [[Nermal]] in a box and ship him to Abu Dhabi. A common phrase from Garfield is &quot;Abu Dhabi is where all the cute kittens go.&quot; The reason is that the author of Garfield found out through over-seas relations that the city of Abu Dhabi, and the majority of UAE, has a large amount of cats that roam wild. Many live around the suburbs.

The letter '''A''' is the first letter in the [[Latin alphabet]]. Its name in [[English language|English]] is ''a'', plural ''aes,'' ''a's,'' or ''as''.

==History==
The letter A probably started as a [[pictogram]] of an [[ox]] head in [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s or the [[Proto-semitic alphabet]].

{| align=&quot;center&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|[[Image:EgyptianA-01.png|Egyptian hieroglyphic ox head]]&lt;br /&gt;Egyptian hieroglyph&lt;br /&gt;ox head
|[[Image:Proto-semiticA-01.png|Proto-semitic ox head]]&lt;br /&gt;Proto-semitic&lt;br /&gt;ox head
|[[Image:PhoenicianA-01.png|Phoenician aleph]]&lt;br /&gt;Phoenician ''aleph''
|[[Image:GreekA-01.png|Greek alpha]]&lt;br /&gt;Greek ''alpha''
|[[Image:EtruscanA-01.png|Etruscan A]]&lt;br /&gt;Etruscan A
|[[Image:RomanA-01.png|Roman A]]&lt;br /&gt;Roman A
|}

By [[1600 BC]], the [[Phoenician alphabet]]'s letter had a linear form that served as the basis for all later forms. Its name must have corresponded closely to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] [[Aleph (letter)|aleph]]. The name is also similar to the Arabic [[Alif|alif.]]

When the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the [[glottal stop]] that the letter had denoted in Phoenician and other [[Semitic languages]], so they used the sign for the vowel {{IPA|/&amp;#593;/}}, and changed its name to [[alpha (letter)|alpha]]. In the earliest Greek inscriptions, dating to the [[8th century BC]], the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to what was [[Italy]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic alphabet|Etruscan alphabet]] to write [[Latin]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the modern [[Latin alphabet]] used to write many languages, including [[English language|English]].

The letter has two [[minuscule]] (lower-case) forms. The form used in most current handwriting consists of a circle and vertical stroke. Most printed material uses a form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it. Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the Uncial version below. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

==Usage==
In [[English language|English]], the letter A by itself usually denotes the [[lax open front unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA2|æ}}) as in ''pad'', the [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA2|ɑ}}) as in ''father'', or, in concert with a later orthographic [[e]], the diphthong {{IPA2|eʲ}} (though the pronunciation varies with the dialect) as in ''ace'', due to effects of the [[Great vowel shift]].

In most other languages that use the Latin alphabet, the letter A denotes either an [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA2|ɑ}}), or an [[open central unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA2|a}}). 

In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], variants of the letter A denote various [[vowel]]s. In [[X-SAMPA]], capital A denotes the [[open back unrounded vowel]] and lowercase a denotes the [[open front unrounded vowel]].

A also is the English [[indefinite article]], extended to [[an]] before a vowel.

In [[Unicode]] the [[majuscule|capital]] A is codepoint U+0041 and the [[minuscule|lowercase]] a is U+0061.

In [[Hexadecimal|Hex]], A is the character used to represent decimal 10, or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]], 01010

The [[ASCII]] code for capital A is 65 and for lowercase a is 97; or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 01000001 and 01100001, correspondingly.

The [[EBCDIC]] code for capital A is 193 and for lowercase a is 129.

The [[numeric character reference]]s in [[HTML]] and [[XML]] are &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#65;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#97;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; for upper and lower case respectively.

'''Alabama''' is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[United States]].

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Alabama]]''

The memory of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] presence is particularly strong in Alabama. Among Native American people once living in present Alabama were [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]] (Alibamu), [[Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Creek people|Creek]], [[Koasati]], and [[Mobile (people)|Mobile]].  Trade with the Northeast via the [[Ohio River]] began during the Burial Mound Period  ([[1000 BC]]-A.D. [[700]]) and continued until European contact.  Meso-American influence is evident in the agrarian Mississippian culture that followed.

The [[France|French]] established the first [[Europe]]an settlement in the state with the establishment of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in [[1702]].  Southern Alabama was French from [[1702]]&amp;ndash;[[1763]], part of British West Florida from [[1763]]&amp;ndash;[[1780]], and part of Spanish West Florida from [[1780]]&amp;ndash;[[1814]]. Northern and central Alabama was part of British Georgia from [[1763]]&amp;ndash;[[1783]] and part of the American Mississippi territory thereafter. Its statehood delayed by the lack of a coastline (rectified when Andrew Jackson captured Spanish Mobile in [[1814]]), Alabama became the 22nd state in [[1819]].

The state of Alabama seceded from the Union on [[January 11]], [[1861]] and became the [[Alabama Republic]] and on [[February 18]] [[1861]] became a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate state]].  While not many battles were fought in the state, it contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]].  After the war a provisional government was set up in [[1865]] and Alabama was officially readmitted to the Union on July 14 [[1868]].

The cradle of the Confederacy during the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]], Alabama was at stage center in the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]] of the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]].

==Law and government==
''Main article: [[Law and Government of Alabama]]''
===Local &amp; County Government===
Alabama has 67 [[county|counties]], each having its own elected legislative branch, usually called the Board of Commissioners, which usually also has executive authority in the county.  Due to the restraints placed in the [[Alabama Constitution]], all but 7 counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no [[home rule]].  Instead, most counties in the state have to lobby to the Local Legislation Committee the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.

Alabama is an alcohol monopoly or [[Alcoholic beverage control state]].

===Political Climate===
The current governor of the state is [[Bob Riley (Alabama)|Bob Riley]] and the two U.S. senators are [[Jeff Sessions|Jefferson B. Sessions III]] and [[Richard Shelby|Richard C. Shelby]] (all three from the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]).  The current [[Alabama Constitution]] was adopted in [[1901]].

During [[Reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In [[1877]], the Reconstruction period ended with the recognition of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] as President-elect. [[White people|White]] Southerners assumed control of the government and passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise black residents.  The state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]],&quot; a one-party system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] became essentially the only political party in every Southern state.  For nearly 100 years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with generally no Republican challenger running. 

From [[1876]] through [[1956]], Alabama supported only Democratic presidential candidates, by margins as high as 73 percentage points.  In [[1960]], Alabama gave most of its electoral votes to [[Harry F. Byrd]] as a protest.  In [[1964]], the national [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] began to win more votes in the South by following a &quot;[[Southern Strategy]]&quot; which emphasized &quot;[[States' rights|states' rights]]&quot; and the increasing liberalism of the national Democratic Party.  The first such candidate was conservative [[Barry Goldwater]], who became the first Republican candidate supported by Alabama.  In [[1968]], Alabama supported native son and [[American Independent Party]] candidate [[George Wallace]].  

The last Democratic candidate to win Alabama's votes in a presidential election was Southerner [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[1976]].  Today, the Republican party has become increasingly dominant in conservative Alabama politics. However, in local politics, Democrats still control many offices, including majorities in both houses of the Legislature, and registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state.  In 2004, [[George W. Bush]] won Alabama's nine electoral votes by a margin of 25 percentage points with 62.5% of the vote.  The only 11 counties voting Democratic were [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] counties, where [[African American]]s are in the majority.

Alabama is located in the [[Bible Belt]], and its educational policies reflect this. According to the [[Alan Guttmacher Institute]], Alabama requires sex education classes to emphasize &quot;that [[homosexuality]] is not an acceptable lifestyle to the general public and that homosexual conduct is a criminal offense under the laws of the state.&quot; While the mandate is not typically enforced in Alabama classrooms, it is unclear whether or not the official requirements have changed since the Supreme Court's ruling in [[Lawrence v. Texas]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], in 2000, Alabama was home to 4,561 same-sex male couples and 4,167 same-sex female couples.

==Geography==
''Main article: [[Geography of Alabama]]''

{{ussm|alabama.PNG|al}}
Alabama is the 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; largest state in the United States with 135,775 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (52,423 mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of total area.  3.19% of that is water, making Alabama 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second largest inland waterway system in the [[United States]].  About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle [[plain]] with a general incline towards the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  The [[North Alabama]] region is mostly mountainous, with the [[Tennessee River]] cutting a large valley creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.  The lowest point east of the [[Mississippi River]] lies in [[Dekalb County]] along a creek cutting tower ridges, and creating [[Buck's Pocket State Park]].  Another natural wonder is &quot;Land Bridge&quot; the longest natural bridge span east of the [[Mississippi River]].  Alabama generally ranges in [[elevation]] from [[sea level]] at [[Mobile Bay]], to a little more than 1800 [[foot (unit)|feet]] or 550 [[metre|meters]] in the Appalachian mountains in the northeast.  The highest point is [[Mount Cheaha]].

==Economy==
[[Image:wiki_alabama.jpg|thumb|275px|Greetings from Alabama]]
According to the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], the [[2003]] total [[gross state product]] was $132 billion. The [[per capita income]] for the state was $26,505 in 2003. Alabama's [[agricultural]] outputs include [[poultry]] and [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[cattle]], plant nursery items, [[peanut]]s, [[cotton]], [[grains]] such as [[maize|corn]] and [[sorgum]], [[vegetables]], [[milk]], [[soybeans]], and [[peaches]]. Even though neighboring [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] is called the [[Peach State]], Alabama produces twice as many peaches annually. Its [[Industry|industrial]] outputs include [[iron]] and [[steel]] products, including cast-iron and steel pipe, [[paper]], [[lumber]], and [[wood]] products, [[mining]] (mostly coal), and [[plastic]] products, cars and trucks, and [[apparel]]. Also, Alabama produces [[aerospace]] and [[electronic]] products, mostly in the [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] area, home of the [[NASA]] [[George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]] and the [[United States Army Aviation and Missile Command|US Army Missile Command]], headquartered at [[Redstone Arsenal]].

Also, the city of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] is a busy seaport on the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and with inland waterway access to the Midwest via the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]].

[[Image:The_wrath_of_Achilles.jpg|220px|thumb|right|The wrath of Achilles, by Léon Benouville]]{{Greek myth}}In [[Greek mythology]], '''{{polytonic|&amp;#7944;χιλλεύς}}''', transliterated to '''Akhilleus''' or '''Achilleus'' in Roman letters, Latinized from this ancient Greek to '''Achilles''', appearing in Etruscan as '''Achle''', was a [[hero]] (ancient Greek heros, &quot;defender&quot;) of the [[Trojan War]], the greatest and the most [[central character]] of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. 

==Name==
The very first two lines of the ''Iliad'' read:
:{{Polytonic|μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος}}
:{{Polytonic|οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκεν,}}
Transliterated:
:Mēnin aeide thea, Pēlēiadeō Akhilēos
:oulomenēn, hē muri' Akhaiois alge' ethēken,
Translated:
:Sing, Muse, the wrath of Achilles the son of Peleus,
:the destructive wrath, that brought countless griefs upon the Achaeans,
[[Image:G-achilles-trojan-wars-bb-l.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Achilles]]In these lines, we see the name Akhilleus Peleides, which is a [[praenomen]] and a [[patronymic]], the latter being formed from Peleus with the suffix -ides producing ''Achilles the son of [[Peleus]]''. The system is similar to the names used by [[Scandinavians]] before modern times, such as Leif Erikson. 


Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of {{Polytonic|ἄχος}} (''akhos'') &quot;grief&quot; and {{Polytonic|λαός}} (''laos'') &quot;a people, tribe, nation, etc.&quot; [http://www.stanford.edu/group/shl/Crowds/hist/laos.htm]  In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad (frequently by Achilles). Achilles' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of ''kleos'' (glory, usually glory in war).

''Laos'' has been construed by Gregory Nagy, following Leonard Palmer, to mean ''a corps of soldiers''. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: When the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

==Birth==
Achilles was the son of the mortal [[Peleus]], king of the [[Myrmidons]] in [[Phthia]] (southeast [[Thessaly]]), and the sea nymph [[Thetis]]. [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until [[Prometheus]] the fire-bringer prophesized that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed to Peleus.

When Achilles was born, according to the most common version of the myth, Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]]. But she forgot to wet the heel she held him by, leaving him vulnerable at that spot. (See [[Achilles' tendon]].) In an earlier and less popular version of the story, Thetis anointed the boy in [[ambrosia]] and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage. Homer does not make reference to this invulnerability in the [[Iliad]]. To the contrary, he mentions Achilles being wounded, although not seriously.

Peleus gave him (together with his young friend or lover [[Patroclus]]) to [[Chiron]] the [[Centaur]], on Mt. [[Pelion]], to be raised.

==Achilles in the Trojan War==
===Telephus===
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in [[Mysia]], ruled by King [[Telephus]]. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that &quot;he that wounded shall heal&quot;.

According to other reports in [[Euripides]]' lost play about Telephus, he went to [[Aulis]] pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. [[Odysseus]] reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed. This is an example of [[sympathetic magic]].

===During the Trojan War===
[[Image:The_Rage_of_Achilles_by_Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|“The Rage of Achilles” by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].]]

In Homer's Iliad, Achilles is the only mortal to experience consuming rage (''menon'').  His anger is at some times wavering, at other times absolute.  The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the ''[[Iliad]]''.

Achilles' [[charioteer]]'s name was [[Automedon]].

====Troilus====
According to [[Dares Phrygius]]' ''Account of the Destruction of Troy'' [http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/DaresTW.html], while [[Troilus]], the youngest son of [[Priam]] and [[Hecuba]] (whom some say was fathered by [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]]), was watering his horses at the Lion Fountain outside the walls of Troy, Achilles saw him and fell in love with his beauty (whose &quot;loveliness of form&quot; was described by [[Ibycus]] as being like &quot;gold thrice refined&quot;). The youth rejected his advances and took refuge inside the temple of Apollo. Achilles pursued him into the sanctuary and decapitated him on the god's own altar. ([[John Tzetzes|Tzetzes]], [[scholiast]] on [[Lycophron]]). At the time, Troilus was said to be a year short of his twentieth birthday, and the legend goes that if Troilus had lived to be twenty, Troy would have been invincible. ([[First Vatican Mythographer]])

====Agamemnon and the death of Patroclus====
[[Image:Patrocluspederastyscene.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Patroclus]] and Achilles. Achilles bandages the arm of his friend Patroclus. The latter turns his head aside to avoid the sight of blood and of Achilles noticing his pain grimaces. The scene has been interpreted as an act of welfare and comradeship, or as a scene with sexual overtones. Ancient Greek culture often held the two [[Iliad#The_relationship_of_Achilles_and_Patroclus|to be lovers]].]]

Achilles took 23 towns outside [[Troy]], including [[Lyrnessos]], where he captured [[Briseis]] to keep as a [[concubine]]. Meanwhile, [[Agamemnon]] took a woman named [[Chryseis]] and taunted her father, [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]], when he attempted to buy her back. Apollo sent a plague through the Greek armies, and Agamemnon was forced to give Chryseis back to her father; however, he took Briseis away from Achilles as compensation for his loss.

This action sparked the central plot of the [[Iliad]]: Achilles becomes enraged and refuses to fight for the Greeks any further. The war goes badly, through the influence of [[Zeus]], and the Greeks offer handsome reparations to their greatest warrior.  After the Greeks are pushed back to the ships, which are just starting to be set on fire by the Trojan hero [[Hector]], Achilles is visited by [[Odysseus]], [[Telamonian Aias|Ajax]], and [[Phoenix (Iliad)|Phoenix]], who attempt to persuade him to return to battle.  

Achilles still refuses to fight, but agrees to allow [[Patroclus]] to fight in his place, wearing his armor. The next day, [[Patroclus]] is killed and stripped of the armor by Hector, who mistakes him for Achilles. Achilles is overwhelmed with grief for his beloved friend, and the rage he once harbored toward Agamemnon begins shifting to Hector. Thetis, his mother, rises from the sea floor and sympathizes with his grief. She obtains magnificent new armor for him from [[Hephaestus]]. The goddess [[Athena]] provides him with the [[aegis]] of Zeus.

When he goes to the battlefield, the entire Trojan army flees behind the walls of Troy. Achilles' wrath is terrible, and he slays many Trojan warriors and allies, including Priam's son [[Lycaon]] (whom Achilles had previously captured and sold into slavery, but who had been returned to Troy). Eventually Hector comes out of the walls to defend the honour of Troy. He asked Achilles to agree that the body of the loser would be returned for proper burial by the winner. Achilles rejected this arrangement, saying,  &quot;Though twenty ransoms and thy weight in gold were offered, I would refuse it all.&quot; 

Stories tell that Hector ran about Troy seven times and Achilles followed him, however seeing that Achilles would not be outrun, Hector stood his ground and fought. Other versions of the tale say that Achilles chased after Hector two times, and one time he was delivered by the gods, however, on their second encounter, Achilles trapped Hector and challenged him. After a legendary fight, Achilles kills Hector.

Influenced by his anger, he drags the body of Hector behind his chariot round the walls of Troy three times, and refuses to allow it to receive [[funeral rites]].  Much to the dismay of Achilles, the body of Hector miraculously heals and will not decay as normally expected. [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love who sided with Troy throughout the whole conflict, put a protective barrier over [[Hector]], which kept him looking like he did before he was viciously killed by Achilles. When [[Priam]], the king of Troy and Hector's father, comes secretly into the Greek camp to plead for the body, Achilles finally relents; in one of the most moving scenes of the ''Iliad'', he receives Priam graciously and allows him to take the body away.  The scene is intensely moving because [[Priam]], the king of one of the greatest cities in the known world, kneels down, old and frail as he is, and kisses the hands of the man who killed his son.

The greatness of Achilles lies in not just being the greatest Greek fighter ever, but in knowing the choice provided to him by [[Destiny]]. His mother Thetis had prophesied to him that if he pulled out of the [[Trojan War]], he would enjoy a long and a happy life. If Achilles fought, however, he would die before the walls of [[Troy]] but assure an everlasting glory, surpassing that of all other heroes. He had made the choice, and coming face to face with it showed his greatness.

====Xanthos====
During the [[Trojan War]], [[Balius and Xanthos|Xanthos]], one of Achilles' horses, was rebuked by Achilles for allowing [[Patroclus]] to be killed. Xanthos responded by saying (Hera temporarily gave him voice to do so) that a god and a mortal had killed Patroclus and a god and a mortal would soon kill Achilles  too.

====Memnon, Cycnus, Penthesilea, and the death of Achilles====
[[Image:TBanksThetis.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Thetis rising from the sea to comfort Achilles'' (Book 18), by [[Thomas Banks]], English, [[1778]] [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].]]
Shortly after the death of [[Hector]], Achilles defeated [[Memnon]] of [[Ethiopia]], [[Cycnus]] of [[Colonae]] and the [[Amazons|Amazonian]] warrior [[Penthesilia]] (with whom Achilles also had an affair in some versions). As predicted by [[Hector]] with his dying breath, Achilles was thereafter killed by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] &amp;mdash; either by an arrow to the heel (which may have subsequently become fatally infected, and is said to have been guided by [[Apollo]]), or in an older version by a knife to the back while visiting [[Polyxena]], a princess of Troy. Both versions conspicuously deny the killer any sort of valor, and Achilles remains undefeated on the battlefield (Paris was later killed by Philoctetes using the enormous bow of Heracles). His bones are mingled with those of [[Patroclus]], and funeral games are held. Like Ajax, he is represented (although not by [[Homer]]) as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the [[Danube]].

====The fate of Achilles' armor====
Achilles' armor was the object of a feud between [[Odysseus]] and [[Telamonian Aias|Ajax the Greater]] (Achilles' older cousin). They competed for it and Odysseus won. Ajax went mad with grief and vowed to kill his comrades; he started killing cattle (thinking they were Greek soldiers), and then himself.

==Other stories about Achilles==	 
Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hid the young man at the court of [[Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]].  There, Achilles was disguised as a girl and lived among Lycomedes' daughters under the name &quot;Pyrrha&quot; (the red-haired girl).  With Lycomedes' daughter [[Deidamea|Deidamia]], Achilles fathered a son, [[Neoptolemus]] (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's alias).  According to this story, Odysseus learned from the prophet [[Calchas]] that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid.  He went to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry, but placed a shield and spear among his goods.  When Achilles instantly took up the spear, Odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the Trojan campaign.  In another version of the story, Odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women fled in panic, Achilles prepared to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.  The story about Achilles in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] is not found in Homer.

In Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', there is a passage in which Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as &quot;blessed in life, blessed in death&quot;, responds that he would rather be a slave than be dead. This has been interpreted as a rejection of his warrior life, but also as indignity to his martyrdom being slighted.

The kings of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epiran princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor; he is said to have visited his tomb while passing Troy. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the [[Greek colonies]] on the [[Black Sea]].

The [[homosexual]] [[Achilles and Patroclus|relationship between Achilles and Patroclus]] is something much explored in post-[[Homeric]] literature.  By the fifth and fourth centuries, the deep — and arguably ambiguous — friendship portrayed in Homer blossomed into an unequivocal love affair in the works of [[Aeschylus]], [[Plato]], and [[Aeschines]], and seems to have inspired the enigmatic verses in [[Lycophron]]'s third century ''Alexandra'' that claim Achilles slayed Troilus in a matter of unrequited love.

Achilles fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Helene (mythology)|Helene]].

Some also said he married [[Medea]], and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades - as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius' [[Argonautica]].

==Achilles in lost plays==
In the early [[1990]]s a lost play by [[Aeschylus]] was discovered in the wrappings of a [[mummy]] in [[Egypt]]. The play, ''[[Achilles (play)|Achilles]]'', was part of a [[trilogy]] about the [[Trojan War]]. It was known to exist due to mentions in ancient sources, but had been lost for over 2,000 years.  Another lost play by Aeschylus, ''The Myrmidons'', focussed on the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus; only a few lines survive today.

There is another lost play with Achilles as the main character, ''The Lovers of Achilles'', by [[Sophocles]].

'''Abraham Lincoln''' ([[February 12]], [[1809]] – [[April 15]], [[1865]]), sometimes called '''Abe Lincoln''' and nicknamed '''Honest Abe''', the '''Rail Splitter''', and the '''Great Emancipator''', was the 16th [[President of the United States]] (1861 to 1865), and the first president from the [[History of United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. Lincoln opposed the expansion of slavery and oversaw the Union war effort during the [[American Civil War]]. He selected the generals and approved their strategy; selected senior civilian officials; supervised diplomacy, patronage and party affairs; rallied public opinion through messages and speeches such as the [[Gettysburg Address]]; and took personal charge of plans for the [[Emancipation Proclamation|abolition of slavery]] and the [[Reconstruction]] of the Union. He was assassinated as the war ended by [[John Wilkes Booth]]. 

==Role in history==
President Lincoln was opposed to what he saw as the [[Slave Power]] and staunchly opposed its efforts to expand [[history of slavery in the United States|slavery]] into federal territories. His victory in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]] further polarized an already divided nation. Before his inauguration in March of 1861, seven [[Southern United States|Southern]] states [[secession|seceded]] from the [[United States]], formed the [[Confederate States of America]], and took control of U.S. forts and other properties within their boundaries. These events soon led to the [[American Civil War]].

Lincoln is often praised for his work as a wartime leader who proved adept at balancing competing considerations and at getting rival groups to work together toward a common goal. Lincoln had to negotiate between [[Radical Republican|Radical]] and Moderate Republican leaders, who were often far apart on the issues, while attempting to win support from [[War Democrats]] and loyalists in the seceding states. He personally directed the war effort, in close cooperation (1864-65) with General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] which ultimately led the Union forces to victory over the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. 

His leadership qualities were evident in his diplomatic handling of the border slave states at the beginning of the fighting, in his defeat of a congressional attempt to reorganize his cabinet in 1862, in his many speeches and writings which helped mobilize and inspire the North, and in his defusing of the peace issue in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential campaign]]. [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] vehemently criticized him for violating the Constitution, overstepping the bounds of executive power, refusing to compromise on slavery, declaring [[martial law]], suspending [[habeas corpus]], ordering the arrest of thousands of public officials and a number of newspaper publishers, and killing hundreds of thousands of young men. [[Radical Republicans]] criticized him for going too slow on abolition of slavery, and not being ruthless enough toward the conquered South.

Lincoln is most famous for his roles in preserving the Union and ending [[slavery]] in the United States with the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  However, some abolitionists criticized him for only freeing the slaves under the Confederacy in 1863, and waiting until 1865 to free slaves held in the Union. 

Historians have argued that Lincoln had a lasting influence on U.S. political and social institutions, importantly setting a precedent for greater centralization of powers in the federal government and the weakening of the powers of the individual [[state government]]s. 

Lincoln spent most of his attention on military matters and politics but with his strong support his administration established the current system of [[national bank]]s with the [[National Bank Act]]. He increased the [[Morrill tariff|tariff]] to raise revenue and encourage factories, imposed the first [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]], issued hundreds of millions of dollars of bonds and Greenbacks, encouraged immigration from Europe, built the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]], set up the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], encouraged farm ownership with the [[Homestead Act]] of 1862, and set up the modern system of state universities with the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]].  During the war his Treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South--the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy. During his administration [[West Virginia]] and [[Nevada]] were admitted as states.

Lincoln is usually [[historical rankings of U.S. Presidents|ranked as one of the greatest presidents]]. Because of his roles in destroying slavery, redefining national values, and saving the Union, his [[assassination]] made him a [[martyr]] to millions of Americans.  However, others considered him an unconstitutional tyrant for declaring martial law, suspending civil liberties, habeas corpus, and the First Amendment, and ordering the arrest of thousands of public officials and newspaper publishers.

==Early life==
Abraham Lincoln was born on [[February 12]], [[1809]], in a one-room [[log cabin]] on the 348 acre (1.4 km&amp;sup2;) Sinking Spring Farm in the Southeast part of [[Hardin County, Kentucky]], then considered the [[frontier]] (now part of [[LaRue County, Kentucky|LaRue Co.]], in Nolin Creek, three miles (5 km) south of  [[Hodgenville, Kentucky|Hodgenville]]), to [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Hanks]]. Lincoln was named after his deceased grandfather, who was [[scalping|scalped]] in 1786 in an Indian raid. He had no middle name. Lincoln's parents were uneducated, illiterate farmers. When Lincoln became famous, reporters and storytellers often exaggerated the poverty and obscurity of his birth. However Lincoln's father Thomas was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky backcountry. He had purchased the [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site|Sinking Spring Farm]] in December 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt. His parents belonged to a Baptist church that had pulled away from a larger church because they refused to support slavery.  From a very young age, Lincoln was exposed to anti-slavery sentiment.  However he never joined his parents' church, or any other church, and as a youth ridiculed religion.  

Three years after purchasing the property, a prior land claim filed in Hardin Circuit Court forced the Lincolns to move. Thomas continued legal action until he lost the case in 1815. Legal expenses contributed to family difficulties. In 1811, they were able to lease 30 acres (0.1 km&amp;sup2;) of a 230 acre (0.9 km&amp;sup2;) farm on Knob Creek a few miles away, where they then moved. In a valley of the [[Rolling Fork River]], this was some of the best farmland in the area. At this time, Lincoln's father was a respected community member and a successful farmer and carpenter. Lincoln's earliest recollections are from this farm.  In 1815, another claimant sought to eject the family from the [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site|Knob Creek farm]].  Frustrated with litigation and lack of security provided by Kentucky courts, Thomas decided to move to [[Indiana]], which had been surveyed by the federal government, making land titles more secure.  It is possible that these episodes motivated Abraham to later learn surveying and become an attorney.  

In 1816, when Lincoln was seven years old, he and his parents moved to [[Spencer County, Indiana]], he would state &quot;partly on account of slavery&quot; and partly because of economic difficulties in Kentucky. In 1818, Lincoln's mother died of &quot;[[milk sickness]]&quot; at age thirty four, when Abe was nine.  Soon afterwards, Lincoln's father remarried to Sarah Bush Johnston.  Sarah Lincoln raised young Lincoln like one of her own children.  Years later she compared Lincoln to her own son, saying &quot;Both were good boys, but I must say — both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see.&quot; (''Lincoln'', by David Herbert Donald, 1995)

In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on government land on a site selected by Lincoln's father in [[Macon County, Illinois]]. The following winter was especially brutal, and the family nearly moved back to Indiana. When his father relocated the family to a nearby site the following year, the 22-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, [[canoe]]ing down the Sangamon to [[Sangamon County, Illinois]] (now in [[Menard County, Illinois|Menard County]]), in the village of [[New Salem (Menard County), Illinois|New Salem]]. Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman [[Denton Offutt]] and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] via [[flatboat]] on the Sangamon, [[Illinois River|Illinois]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] [[river]]s. While in New Orleans, he may have witnessed a slave auction that left an indelible impression on him for the rest of his life. Whether he actually witnessed a slave auction at that time or not, living in a country with a considerable slave presence, he probably saw similar atrocities from time to time.

His formal education consisted of perhaps 18 months of schooling from itinerant teachers. In effect he was self-educated, studying every book he could borrow.  He mastered the Bible, Shakespeare, English history and American history, and developed a plain style that puzzled audiences more used to orotund oratory.  He avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals even for food and, though unusually tall and strong, spent so much time reading that some neighbors thought he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor. He was skilled with an axe—they called him the &quot;rail splitter&quot;—and a good wrestler.

==Early career==
Lincoln began his political career in 1832 at the age of 23 with a campaign for the [[Illinois General Assembly]] as a member of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the [[Sangamon River]] in the hopes of attracting [[steamboat]] traffic to the river, which would allow sparsely populated, poor areas along and near the river to grow and prosper. He served as a captain in a company of the [[Illinois]] [[militia]] drawn from New Salem during the [[Black Hawk War]], although he never saw combat.  He wrote after being elected by his peers that he had not had &quot;any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.&quot;

He later tried and failed at several small-time business ventures. He held an Illinois state [[liquor]] license and sold whiskey.  Finally, after coming across the second volume of [[Sir William Blackstone]]'s four-volume ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', he taught himself the [[law]], and was admitted to the [[Illinois State Bar Association|Illinois Bar]] in 1837. That same year, he moved to [[Springfield, Illinois]] and began to practice law with [[Stephen T. Logan]]. He became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in the prairie state, and grew steadily more prosperous. Lincoln served four successive terms in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]], as a representative from [[Sangamon County, Illinois|Sangamon County]], beginning in 1834.  He became a leader of the Whig party in the legislature.  In 1837 he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was &quot;founded on both injustice and bad policy.&quot; [http://www.hti.umich.edu/l/lincoln/]

Lincoln shared a bed with [[Joshua Fry Speed]] from 1837 to 1841 in Springfield. While many historians claim it was not uncommon in the mid-19th century for men to share a bed (just as two men today may share a house or an apartment), gay activist [[C. A. Tripp]] generated controversy with his 2005 book ''[[The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln]]'', which suggested their relationship may also have been sexual.  

In 1841, Lincoln entered law practice with [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], a fellow Whig. In 1856, both men joined the fledgling [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Following Lincoln's assassination, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln from those who knew him in central Illinois, eventually publishing a book, ''Herndon's Lincoln''.  Lincoln never joined an antislavery society and denied he supported the abolitionists.  He married into a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky, and allowed his children to spend time there surrounded by slaves. Several of his in-laws became Confederate officers.  He greatly admired the science that flourished in New England, and was perhaps the only father in Illinois at the time to send his son, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], to elite eastern schools, [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and [[Harvard College]].

==Marriage==
On [[November 4]], [[1842]], at the age of 33, Lincoln married [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]]. The couple had four sons.
*[[Robert Todd Lincoln]]: b. [[August 1]], [[1843]], in Springfield, Illinois; d. [[July 26]], [[1926]], in [[Manchester, Vermont]].
*[[Edward Baker Lincoln]]: b. [[March 10]], [[1846]], in Springfield, Illinois; d. [[February 1]], [[1850]], in Springfield, Illinois. 
*[[William Wallace Lincoln]]: b. [[December 21]], [[1850]], in Springfield, Illinois; d. [[February 20]], [[1862]], in Washington, D.C.
*[[Thomas (Tad) Lincoln]]: b. [[April 4]], [[1853]], in Springfield, Illinois; d. [[July 16]], [[1871]], in [[Chicago, Illinois]].

Only Robert survived into adulthood. Of Robert's three children, only [[Jessie Harlan Lincoln|Jessie Lincoln]] had any children (two: Mary Lincoln Beckwith and Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith). Neither Robert Beckwith nor Mary Beckwith had any children, so Abraham Lincoln's bloodline ended when Robert Beckwith (Lincoln's great-grandson) died on [[December 24]], [[1985]].

==Illinois politics==
[[Image:Abelincoln1846.jpeg|thumb|Lincoln in 1846 or 1847]]
In 1846, Lincoln was elected to one term in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. A staunch Whig, Lincoln often referred to party leader [[Henry Clay]] as his political idol. As a freshman House member, Lincoln was not a particularly powerful or influential figure in Congress. He used his office as an opportunity to speak out against the [[Mexican-American War|war]] with [[Mexico]], which he attributed to [[James Knox Polk|President Polk]]'s desire for &quot;military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.&quot;

Lincoln was a key early supporter of [[Zachary Taylor]]'s candidacy for the [[U.S. presidential election, 1848|1848 '''Whig Presidential nomination]]. When Lincoln's term ended, the incoming Taylor administration offered him the governorship of remote [[Oregon Territory]]. Acceptance would end his career in the fast-growing state of Illinois, so he declined. Returning instead to [[Springfield, Illinois]] he turned''' most of his energies to making a living at the [[bar (law)|bar]], which involved extensive travel on horseback from county to county.

==Prairie lawyer==
By the mid-1850s, Lincoln faced competing transportation interests — both the river [[barge]]s and the [[railroad]]s. In 1849, he received a patent related to buoying vessels. Lincoln represented the [[Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad]] in an 1851 dispute with one of its shareholders, [[James A. Barret]]. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to that corporation on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer proposed Alton &amp; Sangamon route was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue Mr. Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States.

Another important example of Lincoln's skills as a railroad lawyer was a lawsuit over a tax exemption that the state granted to the [[Illinois Central Railroad]]. [[McLean County, Illinois|McLean County]] argued that the state had no authority to grant such an exemption, and it sought to impose taxes on the railroad notwithstanding. In January 1856, the Illinois Supreme Court delivered its opinion upholding the tax exemption, accepting Lincoln's arguments.

Lincoln's most notable criminal trial came in 1858 when he defended [[William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who was on trial for the murder of [[James Preston Metzker]]. The case is famous for Lincoln's use of [[judicial notice]], a rare tactic at that time, to show an eyewitness had lied on the stand, claiming he witnessed the crime in the moonlight. Lincoln produced a [[Farmer's Almanac]] to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle it could not have produced enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based upon this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.

==Republican politics 1854-1860==
The [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] of 1854, which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's spread that had been part of the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820, drew Lincoln back into politics.

Illinois Democrat [[Stephen A. Douglas]], the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed [[popular sovereignty]] as the solution to the slavery impasse, incorporating it into the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people of a territory should decide whether to allow slavery or not, and not have a decision imposed on them by Congress.

It was a speech against Kansas-Nebraska, on [[October 16]], [[1854]] in [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], that caused Lincoln to stand out among the other [[free soil]] orators of the day. He helped form the new Republican party, drawing on remnants of the old Whig, [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]], Liberty and Democratic parties.  
In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854, and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep party unity he allowed the election to go to his colleague [[Lyman Trumbull]].

In 1857-58 Douglas broke with President [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]], leading to a terrific fight for control of the Democratic party.  Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he led the opposition to the administration's push for the [[Lecompton Constitution]] which would have admitted Kansas as a [[slave state]].  Accepting the Republican nomination for the Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered a famous speech [http://www.nationalcenter.org/HouseDivided.html] in which he stated, &quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot; The speech created a lasting image of the danger of disunion due to slavery, and rallied Republicans across the north.

The 1858 campaign featured the [[Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858|Lincoln-Douglas debates]], a nationally noticed discussion on the issues that threatened to split the nation in two. Lincoln forced Douglas to propose his [[Freeport Doctrine]], which lost him further support among slave-holders and speeded the division of the Democratic Party. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's eloquence transformed him into a national political star.

During the debates of 1858 the issue of race was often discussed. During a time period when racial egalitarianism was considered politically incorrect, Stephen Douglas would inform the crowds, “If you desire negro citizenship…if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves… then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro.” [http://www.nps.gov/liho/debate1.htm (Official Records of Debate)] On the defensive Lincoln countered that he was “not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.”  [http://www.nps.gov/liho/debate4.htm (Official Records of Debate)] Historians generally remained mixed on what Lincoln’s actual views were on race.  However, many tend to doubt that the highly political nature of these debates offer reliable evidence about his personal views. (Team of Rivals, by Doris Kearns Goodwin, 2005) (Lincoln: In Text and Context, by Donald Fehrenbacher, 1987) As Fredrick Douglass observed, “[Lincoln was] the first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color.” (Life and Times of Fredrick Douglass, by Fredrick Douglass, 1895)

Lincoln's opposition to slavery was opposition to the [[Slave Power]], and he was not an abolitionist in 1858. But the Civil War changed everything, and changed Lincoln's beliefs in race relations as well.

==Election of 1860==
[[Image:The Rail Candidate.jpg|thumb|&quot;The Rail Candidate&quot;, political cartoon, 1860]]
Entering the  presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog, Lincoln was eventually chosen as the Republican candidate for the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|1860 election]] for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than rivals [[William H. Seward]] and [[Salmon Chase]]. His &quot;western&quot; origins also appealed to the newer states. Other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party, specifically Seward, who had run afoul of newspaperman [[Horace Greeley]]. During the campaign, Lincoln was dubbed &quot;The Rail Splitter&quot; by Republicans to emphasize the power of &quot;free labor,&quot; whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. 

On [[November 6]], [[1860]], Lincoln was elected the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Douglas, [[John C. Breckenridge]] of the Southern Democrats, and [[John C. Bell]] of the new [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]].  Lincoln was the first Republican president. He won entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South — and won only 2 of 996 counties there. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total,) for 180 electoral votes, Douglas 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes, Breckenridge 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes, and Bell 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes.  There were fusion tickets in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln  had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes, and would still have won the electoral college and the election.

==Secession winter 1860-61==
As Lincoln's election became more and more probable, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. South Carolina took the lead followed by six other [[cotton]]-growing states: Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. The upper South (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to and rejected the secessionist appeal. They decided to stay in the Union, though warning Lincoln they would not support an invasion through their territory. The seven Confederate states seceded before Lincoln took office, declaring themselves an entirely new nation, the [[Confederate States of America]]. President Buchanan and president-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.

President-elect Lincoln survived an [[assassination]] threat in Baltimore, and on [[February 23]], [[1861]] arrived in disguise in Washington. At Lincoln's inauguration on [[March 4]], [[1861]], the [[Turners]] formed Lincoln's bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion or insurrection from Confederates in the capital city. 

[[Image:Abraham lincoln inauguration 1861.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Photograph showing [[March 4]], [[1861]] inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of U.S. Capitol]]
In his [[Lincoln's First Inaugural|First Inaugural]] Address, Lincoln declared, &quot;I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments&quot;, arguing further that the purpose of the [[United States Constitution]] was &quot;to form a more perfect union&quot; than the [[Articles of Confederation]] which were ''explicitly'' perpetual, and thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it? 

Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to unite the Union and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the proposed [[Corwin amendment|Corwin Amendment]] to the constitution, of which he had been a driving force. It would have explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it already existed, and had already passed both houses. Lincoln adamantly opposed the [[Crittenden Compromise]], however, which would have permitted slavery in the territories, renewing the boundary set by the [[Missouri Compromise]] and extending it to [[California]]. Despite support for this compromise among some Republicans, Lincoln declared that were the Crittenden Compromise accepted, it &quot;would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and [[Tierra del Fuego]].&quot; 

Because opposition to slavery expansion was the key issue uniting the Republican Party at the time, Lincoln is sometimes criticized for putting politics ahead of the national interest in refusing any compromise allowing the expansion of slavery. Supporters of Lincoln, however, point out that he did not oppose slavery because he was a Republican, but became a Republican because of his opposition to the expansion of slavery, that he opposed several other Republicans who were in favor of compromise, and that he clearly thought his course of action was in the national interest.  By the time Lincoln took office the Confederacy was an established fact and not a single leader of that country ever proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because no compromise was possible.  Lincoln perhaps could have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However conservative Democratic nationalists, such as [[Jeremiah S. Black]], [[Joseph Holt]], and [[Edwin M. Stanton]] had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession.  Lincoln, and nearly all Republican leaders, adopted this nationalistic position by March, 1861: the Union could not be broken.

==War begins: 1861-1862==
{{main|American Civil War}}
After Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] were fired on and forced to surrender in April, Lincoln called on governors of every state to send 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and &quot;preserve the Union,&quot; which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states.  Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, then seceded, along with North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas. 

The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery in loyal states.

==Emancipation Proclamation==
[[Image:Emancipation_proclamation.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Lincoln met with his Cabinet for the first reading of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] draft on [[July 22]], [[1862]].]]
{{main articles|[[Abraham Lincoln on slavery]] and [[Emancipation Proclamation]]}} 
Congress in July 1862 moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. It provided:
:That if any person shall hereafter incite, set on foot, assist, or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States, or the laws thereof, or shall give aid or comfort thereto, or shall engage in, or give aid and comfort to, any such existing rebellion or insurrection, and be convicted thereof, such person shall be punished by imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten years, or by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars, and by the liberation of all his slaves, if any he have; or by both of said punishments, at the discretion of the court.
:....
:SEC. 9. And be it further enacted, That all slaves of persons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the government of the United States, or who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto, escaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the army; and all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the government of the United States; and all slaves of such person found on [or] being within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by the forces of the United States, shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves.

Thus everyone who 60 days after [[July 17]], [[1862]] supported the rebellion was to be punished by having all their slaves freed. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. This did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the XIII Amendment did that), but it shows Lincoln had the support of (and was even somewhat pushed by) Congress in liberating the slaves owned by rebels.  Lincoln implemented the new law by his &quot;Emancipation Proclamation.&quot; 

Lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the United States and he personally opposed slavery as a profound moral evil not in accord with the principle of equality asserted in the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]]. Yet, Lincoln's views of the role of the federal government on the subject of slavery are more complicated. Before the Confederate states seceded, Lincoln had campaigned against the expansion of slavery into the [[Historic regions of the United States|territories]], where Congress did have authority. However, he maintained that the federal government could not constitutionally bar slavery in states where it already existed. During his presidency, Lincoln made it clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. Freeing the slaves was a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. Lincoln was criticized both at home and abroad for his refusal to take a stand for the complete abolition of slavery. On [[August 22]], [[1862]], a few weeks before signing the Proclamation, and after it had already been drafted, Lincoln responded by letter to an editorial by [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' which had urged abolition: 
:I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be &quot;the Union as it was.&quot; If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.
:I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.[http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm]

With the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] issued in two parts on [[September 22]], [[1862]] and [[January 1]], [[1863]], Lincoln made the abolition of slavery a goal of the war. Lincoln addresses the issue of his consistency (or lack thereof) between his earlier position and his later position on emancipation in an 1864 letter to [[Albert G. Hodges]][http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/hodges.htm] 

Lincoln is often credited with freeing enslaved [[African Americans]] with the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. However, border states that still allowed slavery but were under Union control were exempt from the emancipation because they were not covered under any war measures. The proclamation on its first day, [[January 1]], [[1863]], freed only a few escaped slaves, but as Union armies advanced south more and more slaves were liberated until hundreds of thousands were freed (exactly how many is unknown).  Lincoln signed the Proclamation as a wartime measure, insisting that only the outbreak of war gave constitutional power to the President to free slaves in states where it already existed.  He later said: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot; The proclamation made abolishing slavery in the rebel states an official war goal and it became the impetus for the enactment of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] which abolished slavery; Lincoln was one of the main promoters of that amendment. 

Although some Northern conservatives recoiled at the notion that the war was now being fought for the slaves instead of for preserving the Union, in the end the Emancipation Proclamation  did much to help the Northern cause politically. Lincoln's strong [[abolitionist]] stand finally convinced the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and other foreign countries that they could not support the [[Confederate States of America]].  This move remains one of the great seizures of private property by the federal government, restoring the ownership of the blacks to themselves,

Lincoln had for some time been working on plans to set up [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] in Africa and South America for the nearly 4 million newly freed slaves. He remarked upon colonization favorably in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed.

==Important domestic measures of Lincoln's first term==
[[Image:Lincoln.png|thumb|right|While Lincoln is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1861 at the suggestion of 11-year-old [[Grace Bedell]].]]

Lincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws. He was anti-vescovian. He signed them, vetoing only bills that threatened his war powers.  Thus he signed the [[Homestead Act]] in 1862, making available millions of acres of government-held land in the west for purchase at very low cost. The [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], also signed in 1862, provided government grants for [[agricultural universities]] in each state. Lincoln also signed the Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864, which granted federal support to the construction of the United States' first transcontinental railroad, which was completed in 1869.  The most important legislation involved money matters, including the first income tax and higher tariffs.  Most important was the creation of the system of national banks by the [[National Banking Act]]s of 1863, 1864 and 1865 which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. 

Lincoln sent a senior general to put down the &quot;[[Sioux Uprising |Sioux Uprising]]&quot; of August 1862 in [[Minnesota]]. Presented with 303 death warrants for convicted [[Santee Dakota]] who had massacred innocent farmers, Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution (one was later reprieved).

==1864 election and second inauguration==
After Union victories at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and [[Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]] in 1863, many in the North believed that victory was soon to come after Lincoln appointed [[Ulysses S. Grant|U.S. Grant]] General-in-Chief on [[March 12]], [[1864]].  Although no president since [[Andrew Jackson]] had been elected to a second term (and none since [[Martin Van Buren|Van Buren]] had been re-nominated), Lincoln's re-election was considered a certainty.

However, when the spring campaigns, east and west, all turned into bloody stalemates, Northern morale dipped and Lincoln seemed less likely to be re-nominated.  [[U.S. Treasury Secretary|Treasury Secretary]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] strongly desired the Republican nomination and was working hard to win it, while [[John Fremont]] was nominated by a breakoff group of radical Republicans, potentially taking away crucial votes in the November elections.

Fearing he might lose the election, Lincoln wrote out and signed the following pledge, but did not show it to his cabinet, asking them each to sign the sealed envelope. Lincoln wrote:

:This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected.  Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he can not possibly save it afterwards.

The Democrats, hoping to make setbacks in the war a top campaign issue, waited until late summer to nominate a candidate.  Their platform was heavily influenced by the [[Copperheads (politics)|Peace wing]] of the party, calling the war a &quot;failure,&quot; but their candidate, former General [[George McClellan]], was a [[War Democrats|War Democrat]], determined to prosecute the war until the Union was restored, although willing to compromise on all other issues, including slavery.

McClellan's candidacy was soon undercut as on [[September 1]], just two days after the [[1864 Democratic National Convention|convention]], [[Battle of Atlanta|Atlanta]] was abandoned by the Confederate army.  Coming on the heels of [[David Farragut|David Farragut's]] capture of [[Battle of Mobile Bay|Mobile Bay]] and followed by [[Phil Sheridan|Phil Sheridan's]] crushing victory over [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal Early's]] army at [[Battle of Cedar Creek|Cedar Creek]], it was now apparent that the tide had turned in favor of the Union and that Lincoln may be reelected despite the costs of the war.

Still, Lincoln believed that he would win the [[U.S. Electoral College|electoral vote]] by only a slim margin, failing to give him the [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] he'd need if he was to push his lenient [[reconstruction]] plan.  To his surprise, Lincoln ended up winning all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.

After Lincoln's election, on [[March 4]], [[1865]], he delivered his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]], which was his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was within sight, [[slavery]] had effectively ended, and Lincoln was looking to the future.

:Fondly do we hope--fervently do we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said &quot;the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether&quot;
:With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.

==Civil War and reconstruction==
===Conducting the war effort===
The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and it occupied nearly all of his time. Lincoln had a contentious relationship with General [[George B. McClellan]], who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and after the retirement of [[Winfield Scott]] in late 1861. Lincoln wished to take an active part in planning the war strategy despite his inexperience in military affairs. Lincoln's strategic priorities were two-fold: first, to ensure that Washington, D.C., was well-defended; and second, to conduct an aggressive war effort in hopes of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press, who pushed for an offensive war. McClellan, a youthful [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate and railroad executive called back to military service, took a more cautious approach. McClellan took several months to plan and execute his [[Peninsula Campaign]], which involved capturing [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[James River (Virginia)|James]] and [[York River (Virginia)|York Rivers]]. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did McClellan's insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of his Peninsula Campaign.

McClellan, a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his ''[[Harrison's Landing Letter]]'', where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint fellow Republican [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire for the Union to move towards Richmond from the north, thus guarding Washington, D.C. However, Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] during the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac back into the defenses of Washington for a second time. Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the [[Sioux]]. 

Panicked by Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s invasion of [[Maryland]], Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September 1862. It was the Union victory in that battle that allowed Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln relieved McClellan of command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican [[Ambrose Burnside]] to head the Army of the Potomac, who promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for an aggressive offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Joseph Hooker]] was given command, despite his idle talk about becoming a military strong man. Hooker was routed by Lee at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] in May 1863 and also relieved of command.

After the Union victory at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], [[George G. Meade | Meade's]] failure to pursue Lee, and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac, Lincoln decided to bring in a western general: General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. He had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and [[Battle of Chattanooga III|Chattanooga]]. Earlier, reacting to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, &quot;I cannot spare this man. He fights.&quot; Grant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864, using a strategy of a [[war of attrition]], characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], but by proportionately higher losses in the Confederate army. Grant's aggressive campaign would eventually bottle up Lee in the [[Siege of Petersburg]] and result in the Union taking Richmond and bringing the war to a close in the spring of 1865. 

Lincoln authorized Grant to use a [[scorched earth]] approach to destroy the South's morale and economic ability to continue the war. This allowed Generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Philip Sheridan]] to destroy farms and towns in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[South Carolina]]. The damage in [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million.

Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the [[Mississippi River]] and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. However, he had little success in his efforts to motivate his generals to adopt his strategies. Eventually, he found in Grant a man who shared his vision of the war and was able to bring that vision to reality with his relentless pursuit of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters of war. 

Lincoln, perhaps reflecting his lack of military experience, developed a keen curiosity with military campaigning during the war. He spent hours at the [[United States War Department|War Department]] [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] office, reading dispatches from his generals through many a night. He frequently visited battle sites and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During [[Jubal A. Early]]'s [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raid into Washington, D.C.]], in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck his head to avoid being shot while observing the scenes of battle.

===Homefront===
Lincoln was more successful in giving the war meaning to Northern civilians through his oratorical skills. Despite his meager education and &amp;#8220;backwoods&amp;#8221; upbringing, Lincoln possessed an extraordinary command of the English language, as evidenced by the [[Gettysburg Address]], a speech dedicating a cemetery of Union soldiers from the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] that he delivered on November 19, 1863. While the featured speaker, orator [[Edward Everett]], spoke for two hours, Lincoln's few choice words resonated across the nation and across history, defying Lincoln's own prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.&quot; Lincoln's [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]] is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln articulated better than any of his contemporaries the rationale behind the Union effort.

During the Civil War, Lincoln exercised powers no previous president had wielded; he proclaimed a [[blockade]], suspended the writ of [[habeas corpus]], spent money without [[Congress of the United States|congressional]] authorization, and imprisoned thousands of accused Confederate sympathizers without trial. There is a fragment of uncorraborated evidence that Lincoln made contingency plans to arrest [[Chief Justice]] [[Roger Brooke Taney]], though the allegation remains unresolved and controversial (see the [[Taney Arrest Warrant]] controversy). 

The long war and the issue of emancipation appeared to be severely hampering his prospects and pessimists warned that defeat appeared likely.  Lincoln ran under the Union party banner, composed of War Democrats and Republicans. General Grant was facing severe criticism for his conduct of the bloody [[Overland Campaign]] that summer and the seemingly endless [[Siege of Petersburg]]. However, the Union capture of the key railroad center of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] by Sherman's forces in September changed the situation dramatically and Lincoln was reelected.

===Reconstruction===
The [[reconstruction]] of the Union weighed heavy on the President's mind throughout the war effort. He was determined to take a course that would not permanently alienate the former Confederate states, and throughout the war Lincoln urged speedy elections under generous terms in areas behind Union lines. This irritated congressional Republicans, who urged a more stringent Reconstruction policy. One of Lincoln's few vetoes during his term was of the [[Wade-Davis Bil]]l, an effort by congressional Republicans to impose harsher Reconstruction terms on the Confederate areas. Republicans in Congress retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from [[Louisiana]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Tennessee]] during the war under Lincoln's generous terms.

&quot;Let 'em up easy,&quot; he told his assembled military leaders [[Ulysses S. Grant|Gen. Ulysses S. Grant]] (a future president), [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Gen. William T. Sherman]] and [[David Dixon Porter|Adm. David Dixon Porter]] in an 1865 meeting on the steamer ''River Queen''. When [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], the Confederate capital, was at long last captured, Lincoln went there to make a public gesture of sitting at [[Jefferson Davis]]'s own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, &quot;I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.&quot;

On [[April 9]], [[1865]], Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House]] in [[Virginia]]. This left only [[Joseph Johnston]]'s forces in the East to deal with. Weeks later Johnston would defy Jefferson Davis and surrender his forces to Sherman. Of course, Lincoln would not survive to see the surrender of all Confederate forces; just five days after Lee surrendered, Lincoln was [[assassination|assassinated]]. He was the first President to be assassinated, and the third to die in office.

==Assassination==
[[Image:Lincolnassassination.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: [[Henry Rathbone]], [[Clara Harris]], Mary Todd Lincoln, Lincoln, and Booth.]]

Lincoln had met frequently with Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] as the war drew to a close. The two men planned matters of reconstruction, and it was evident to all that they held each other in high regard. During their last meeting, on [[April 14]], [[1865]] ([[Good Friday]]), Lincoln invited Grant to a social engagement that evening. Grant declined (Grant's wife, [[Julia Dent Grant]], is said to have strongly disliked [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]). The President's eldest son, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], also turned down the invitation. 

[[John Wilkes Booth]], a well-known actor and Southern sympathizer from [[Maryland]], heard that the president and Mrs. Lincoln, along with the Grants, would be attending [[Ford's Theatre]]. Having failed in a plot to kidnap Lincoln earlier, Booth informed his co-conspirators of his intention to kill Lincoln.  Others were assigned to assassinate [[Vice-President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Secretary of State]] [[William Seward]].

Without his [[bodyguard]] [[Ward Hill Lamon]], to whom he related his famous [[dream]] of his own assassination, the Lincolns left to attend the play at Ford's Theater. The play, ''[[Our American Cousin]]'', was a musical comedy by the British writer [[Tom Taylor]]. As Lincoln sat in his state box in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President's box and waited for the funniest line of the play, hoping the laughter would cover the gunshot noise. On stage, actor Harry Hawk said the last words Lincoln would ever hear &quot;Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal—you sockdologizing old man-trap...&quot;. When the laughter came Booth jumped into the box the president was in and aimed a single-shot, round-slug .44 [[caliber]] [[Deringer]] at his head, firing at point-blank range.  The bullet entered behind Lincoln's left ear and lodged behind his right eyeball. Major [[Henry Rathbone]], who was present in the Presidential Box, momentarily grappled with Booth but was severely stabbed and slashed by the assassin. It was believed that Booth then shouted &quot;''[[Sic semper tyrannis]]!''&quot; (Latin: &quot;Thus always to tyrants,&quot; the state motto of Virginia; some accounts say he added &quot;The South is avenged!&quot;) and jumped from the balcony to the stage below, breaking his leg. Despite his injury, Booth managed to limp to his horse and make his escape.

As Booth fled from the theater, a young physician, Dr. [[Charles Leale]], made his way through the audience to Lincoln's box. Leale quickly assessed the wound as mortal. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the [[Petersen House]], where he lay in a coma for nine hours before he expired. Several physicians attended Lincoln, including U.S. Army Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes of the Army Medical Museum. Using a probe, Barnes located some fragments of Lincoln's skull and the ball lodged 6 inches inside his brain. Lincoln, who never regained consciousness, was officially pronounced dead at 7:22 A.M. the next morning, April 15, 1865. Upon his death, Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]] lamented &quot;now he belongs to the ages.&quot; After Lincoln's body was returned to the [[White House]], his body was prepared for his &quot;lying in state&quot; in the [[East Room]]. 

The Army Medical Museum, now named the National Museum of Health and Medicine, has retained in its collection since the time of Lincoln's death, several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display in the museum are the bullet that was fired from the Deringer pistol, ending Lincoln's life, the probe used by Barnes, pieces of his skull and hair and the surgeon's cuff, stained with Lincoln's blood. The museum can be found at [http://www.nmhm.washingtondc.museum/exhibits/nationswounds/lincoln.html www.hmhm.washingtondc.museum]

[[Image:LincolnTrain.jpeg|right|thumbnail|250px|Lincoln's funeral train carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son William, 1,654 miles to Illinois.]]
Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois. The nation mourned a man whom many viewed as the savior of the United States. He was buried in [[Oak Ridge Cemetery]] in Springfield, where a 177 foot (54 m) tall granite tomb surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln was constructed by 1874. To prevent repeated attempts to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, Robert Todd Lincoln had Lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick on [[September 26]], [[1901]].

==Presidential appointments==
===Administration and Cabinet===
Lincoln was known for appointing his enemies and political rivals to high positions in his Cabinet. Not only did he use great political skill in reducing potential political opposition, but he felt he was appointing the best qualified person for the good of the country.

==Legacy and memorials==
Lincoln's death made the President a [[martyr]] to many. Today he is perhaps America's second most famous and beloved President after [[George Washington]]. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the [[historical rankings of U.S. Presidents|greatest presidents in U.S. history]]. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as a figure who personifies [[Image:Lincoln_statue.jpg|thumbnail|200px|[[Daniel Chester French]]'s seated ''Lincoln'' faces the [[National Mall]] to the east.]]
[[Image:MtRushmore Abe close.JPG|thumbnail|100px|Lincoln's bust on Mt. Rushmore.]]classical values of honesty, integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general. Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the [[gay rights]] group [[Log Cabin Republicans]] to the [[insurance]] corporation [[Lincoln Financial Group|Lincoln Financial]]. The [[Lincoln automobile]] is also named after him.

Over the years Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the [[Lincoln, Nebraska|capital of Nebraska]]; with the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] (''pictured, right''); on the U.S. [[U.S. five dollar bill|$5 bill]] and the [[Penny (U.S. coin)|1 cent coin]] (Illinois is the primary opponent to the removal of the penny from circulation); and as part of the [[Mount Rushmore National Memorial]]. [[Lincoln's Tomb]], [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site]] in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], [[New Salem (Menard County), Illinois|New Salem, Illinois]] (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), [[Ford's Theater]] and Petersen House are all preserved as museums. The [[List of U.S. state nicknames|state nickname]] for [[Illinois]] is ''Land of Lincoln''. 

[[Counties of the United States|Counties]] in 18 [[U.S. state]]s ([[Lincoln County, Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[Lincoln County, Colorado|Colorado]], [[Lincoln County, Idaho|Idaho]], [[Lincoln County, Kansas|Kansas]], [[Lincoln County, Minnesota|Minnesota]], [[Lincoln County, Mississippi|Mississippi]], [[Lincoln County, Montana|Montana]], [[Lincoln County, Nebraska|Nebraska]], [[Lincoln County, Nevada|Nevada]], [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|New Mexico]], [[Lincoln County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], [[Lincoln County, Oregon|Oregon]], [[Lincoln County, South Dakota|South Dakota]], [[Lincoln County, Tennessee|Tennessee]], [[Lincoln County, West Virginia|West Virginia]], [[Lincoln County, Washington|Washington]], [[Lincoln County, Wisconsin|Wisconsin]], and [[Lincoln County, Wyoming|Wyoming]]) are named after Lincoln.

On [[February 12]], [[1892]], Abraham Lincoln's birthday was declared to be a federal [[holiday]] in the United States, although in 1971 it was combined with Washington's birthday in the form of [[President's Day]]. February 12 is still observed as a separate legal holiday in many states, including Illinois.

Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site]] in [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]] and [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]]. The [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum]] is also in Springfield. The [[Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery]] is located in [[Elwood, Illinois]].

Statues of Lincoln can be found in other countries. In [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]], is a 13-foot high bronze statue, a gift from the United States, dedicated in 1966 by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. The U.S. received a statue of [[Benito Juárez]] in exchange, which is in Washington, D.C. Juárez and Lincoln exchanged friendly letters, and Mexico remembers Lincoln's opposition to the [[Mexican-American War]]. There is also a statue in [[Tijuana]], Mexico, showing Lincoln standing and destroying the chains of slavery. There are at least three statues of Lincoln in the [[United Kingdom]]—one in [[London]] by [[Augustus St. Gaudens]],  one in [[Manchester]] by [[George Grey Barnard]] and another in [[Edinburgh]] by [[George Bissell (industrialist)|George Bissell]]. 

The [[ballistic missile]] [[submarine]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602)|''Abraham Lincoln'' (SSBN-602)]] and the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|''Abraham Lincoln'' (CVN-72)]] were named in his honor. Also, the [[Liberty ship]], [[SS Nancy Hanks|SS ''Nancy Hanks'']] was named to honor his mother.

In a recent public vote entitled &quot;[[The Greatest American]],&quot; Lincoln placed second (placing first was [[Ronald Reagan]]).

==Trivia==
* Lincoln stood 6'3 3/4&quot; (192.4 cm) tall and thus was the tallest president in U.S. history, just edging out [[Lyndon Johnson]] at 6'3 1/2&quot; (191.8 cm).
* He was born on the same day as [[Charles Darwin]].
* The last surviving self-described witness to Lincoln's assassination was [[Samuel J. Seymour]] (~1860–[[April 14]], [[1956]]), who appeared two months before his death at age 96 on the [[CBS]]-TV [[quiz show]] ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. He said that as a five-year-old he had thought at first that he, himself, had been shot because his nurse, trying to fix a torn place in his blouse, stuck him with a pin at the moment of the gun's discharge.
* According to legend, Lincoln was referred to as &quot;two-faced&quot; by his opponent in the 1858 [[Senate]] election, [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]]. Upon hearing about this Lincoln jokingly replied, &quot;If I had another face to wear, do you really think I would be wearing this one?&quot;
* According to legend, Lincoln also said, as a young man, on his appearance one day when looking in the mirror: &quot;It's a fact, Abe! You are the ugliest man in the world. If ever I see a man uglier than you, I'm going to shoot him on the spot!&quot; It would no doubt, he thought, be an act of mercy.
* Based on written descriptions of Lincoln, including the observations that he was much taller than most men of his day and had long limbs, an abnormally-shaped chest, and loose or lax joints, it has been conjectured since the 1960s that Lincoln may have suffered from [[Marfan syndrome]].
*Lincoln was known to have a case of [[depression]]. During his time in New Salem, Illinois, his fiancee died, and that triggered his depression. His close friends watched over him to make sure he did not commit suicide. He also suffered from nightmares during his term in the [[White House]]. His depression got so severe, he had to hold a cabinet meeting from his bed.
*He once mentioned one of his haunting nightmares to his friend. Lincoln mentioned that he was standing in a mourning crowd surrounding a train, and when he asked a grieving woman what had happened, she replied, &quot;The President has been shot, and he has died.&quot;
*Lincoln is the only American president to hold a [[patent]].  The patent is for a device that lifts [[boat|boats]] over [[shoal|shoals]].

'''Aristotle''' ({{lang-grc|{{{polytonic|Αριστοτέλης}}}}} Aristotelēs [[384 BC]] &amp;ndash; [[March 7]], [[322 BC]]) was an [[ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]], who studied with [[Plato]] and taught [[Alexander the Great]]. He wrote books on many subjects, including [[physics]], [[poetry]], [[zoology]], [[logic]], [[rhetoric]], [[government]], and [[biology]].

Aristotle, along with Plato and [[Socrates]], is generally considered one of the most influential of [[Ancient philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]]. They transformed [[Presocratic]] [[Greek philosophy]] into the foundations of [[Western philosophy]] as we know it. The writings of Plato and Aristotle founded two of the most important schools of [[Ancient philosophy]].

Aristotle valued knowledge gained from the senses and in modern terms would be classed among the  modern [[empiricist]]s (see [[materialism]] and [[empiricism]]).  He also achieved a &quot;grounding&quot; of dialectic in the Topics by allowing interlocutors to begin from commonly held beliefs (''[[Endoxa]]''); his goal being non-contradiction rather than [[Truth]]. He set the stage for what would eventually develop into the empiricist version of [[scientific method]] centuries later. Although he wrote dialogues early in his career, no more than fragments of these have survived. The works of Aristotle that still exist today are in [[treatise]] form and were, for the most part, unpublished texts. These were probably lecture notes or texts used by his students, and were almost certainly revised repeatedly over the course of years. As a result, these works tend to be eclectic, dense and difficult to read. Among the most important ones are ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics]] (or [[Ontology]])'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[De Anima]] (On the Soul)'' and ''[[Poetics]]''.
These works, although connected in many fundamental ways, are very different in both style and substance. 

Aristotle is known for being one of the few figures in history who studied almost every subject possible at the time. In science, Aristotle studied [[anatomy]], [[astronomy]], [[economics]], [[embryology]], [[geography]], [[geology]], [[meteorology]], [[physics]], and [[zoology]]. In philosophy, Aristotle wrote on [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[government]], [[metaphysics]], [[politics]], [[psychology]], [[rhetoric]] and [[theology]]. He also dealt with [[education]], foreign customs, [[literature]] and [[poetry]]. His combined works practically constitute an [[encyclopedia]] of Greek knowledge.

== Biography ==
===Early life and studies at the Academy===
[[Image:Bust of Aristotle.jpg|thumb|A [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Aristotle is a nearly ubiquitous ornament in places of high culture in the [[Western world|West]].]]

Aristotle was born at [[Stageira]], a [[apoikia|colony]] of [[Andros]] on the [[Macedon]]ian peninsula of [[Chalcidice]] in [[384 BC]]. His father, Nicomachus, was court physician to King [[Amyntas III of Macedon]]. It is believed that Aristotle's ancestors held this position under various kings of the Macedons. As such, Aristotle's early education would probably have consisted of instruction in [[medicine]] and [[biology]] from his father. About his mother, Phaestis, little is known. It is known that she died early in Aristotle's life. When Nicomachus also died, in Aristotle's tenth year, he was left an [[orphan]] and placed under the guardianship of his uncle, [[Proxenus of Atarneus]]. He taught Aristotle [[Greek language|Greek]], [[rhetoric]], and [[poetry]] (O'Connor ''et al.'', [[2004]]). Aristotle was probably influenced by his father's medical knowledge; when he went to [[Athens]] at the age of 18, he was likely already trained in the investigation of natural phenomena.

From the age of 18 to 37 Aristotle remained in Athens as a pupil of [[Plato]] and distinguished himself at the ''[[Academy]]''. The relations between Plato and Aristotle have formed the subject of various legends, many of which depict Aristotle unfavourably. No doubt there were divergences of opinion between Plato, who took his stand on sublime, idealistic principles, and Aristotle, who even at that time showed a preference for the investigation of the facts and laws of the physical world. It is also probable that Plato suggested that Aristotle needed restraining rather than encouragement, but not that there was an open breach of friendship. In fact, Aristotle's conduct after the death of Plato, his continued association with [[Xenocrates]] and other [[Platonists]], and his allusions in his writings to Plato's doctrines prove that while there were conflicts of opinion between Plato and Aristotle, there was no lack of cordial appreciation or mutual forbearance. Besides this, the legends that reflect Aristotle unfavourably are traceable to the [[Epicureans]], who were known as slanderers. If such legends were circulated widely by [[patristic]] writers such as [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Gregory Nazianzen]], the reason lies in the exaggerated esteem Aristotle was held in by the early [[Christianity|Christian]] [[heretic]]s, not in any well-grounded historical tradition.

===Aristotle as philosopher and tutor===
After the death of Plato ([[347 BC]]), Aristotle was considered as the next head of the Academy, a position that was eventually awarded to Plato's nephew. Aristotle then went with Xenocrates to the court of [[Hermias]], ruler of [[Atarneus]] in [[Asia Minor]], and married his niece and adopted daughter, Pythia. In [[344 BC]], Hermias was murdered in a rebellion, &lt;!--''(or a Persian attack?)''--&gt; and Aristotle went with his family to [[Mytilene]]. It is also reported that he stopped  on [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]] and briefly conducted biological research. Then, one or two years later, he was summoned to Pella, the Macedonian capital, by King [[Philip II of Macedon]] to become the tutor of [[Alexander the Great]], who was then 13.

[[Plutarch]] wrote that Aristotle not only imparted to Alexander a knowledge of ethics and politics, but also of the most profound secrets of philosophy. We have much proof that Alexander profited by contact with the philosopher, and that Aristotle made prudent and beneficial use of his influence over the young prince (although [[Bertrand Russell]] disputes this). Due to this influence, Alexander provided Aristotle with ample means for the acquisition of books and the pursuit of his scientific investigation.

It is possible that Aristotle also participated in the education of Alexander's boyhood friends, which may have included for example [[Hephaestion]] and [[Harpalus]]. Aristotle maintained a long correspondence with Hephaestion, eventually collected into a book, unfortunately now lost.

According to sources such as Plutarch and [[Diogenes]], Philip had Aristotle's hometown of Stageira burned during the [[340s BC]], and Aristotle successfully requested that Alexander rebuild it. During his tutorship of Alexander, Aristotle was reportedly considered a second time for leadership of the Academy; his companion Xenocrates was selected instead.

===Founder and master of the Lyceum===
In about [[335 BC]], Alexander departed for his Asiatic campaign, and Aristotle, who had served as an informal adviser (more or less) since Alexander ascended the Macedonian throne, returned to Athens and opened his own school of philosophy. He may, as [[Aulus Gellius]] says, have conducted a school of [[rhetoric]] during his former residence in Athens; but now, following Plato's example, he gave regular instruction in philosophy in a [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] dedicated to [[Apollo Lyceios]], from which his school has come to be known as the [[Lyceum]]. (It was also called the [[Peripatetic]] School because Aristotle preferred to discuss problems of philosophy with his pupils while walking up and down -- ''peripateo'' -- the shaded walks -- ''peripatoi'' -- around the gymnasium).

During the thirteen years ([[335 BC]]&amp;ndash;[[322 BC]]) which he spent as teacher of the Lyceum, Aristotle composed most of his writings. Imitating Plato, he wrote ''[[Dialogue]]s'' in which his doctrines were expounded in somewhat popular language. He also composed the several treatises (which will be mentioned below) on physics, metaphysics, and so forth, in which the exposition is more [[didactic]] and the language more technical than in the ''Dialogues''. These writings show to what good use he put the resources Alexander had provided for him. They show particularly how he succeeded in bringing together the works of his predecessors in Greek philosophy, and how he pursued, either personally or through others, his investigations in the realm of natural phenomena. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] claimed that Alexander placed under Aristotle's orders all the hunters, fishermen, and fowlers of the royal kingdom and all the overseers of the royal forests, lakes, ponds and cattle-ranges, and Aristotle's works on zoology make this statement more believable. Aristotle was fully informed about the doctrines of his predecessors, and [[Strabo]] asserted that he was the first to accumulate a great library.

During the last years of Aristotle's life the relations between him and Alexander became very strained, owing to the disgrace and punishment of [[Callisthenes]], whom Aristotle had recommended to Alexander. Nevertheless, Aristotle continued to be regarded at Athens as a friend of Alexander and a representative of Macedonia. Consequently, when Alexander's death became known in Athens, and the outbreak occurred which led to the [[Lamian war]], Aristotle shared in the general unpopularity of the Macedonians. The charge of [[impiety]], which had been brought against [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Socrates]], was now, with even less reason, brought against Aristotle. He left the city, saying (according to many ancient authorities) that he would not give the Athenians a chance to sin a third time against philosophy. He took up residence at his country house at [[Chalcis]], in [[Euboea]], and there he died the following year, [[322 BC]]. His death was due to a disease, reportedly 'of the stomach', from which he had long suffered. The story that his death was due to [[hemlock]] poisoning, as well as the legend that he threw himself into the sea &quot;because he could not explain the [[tide]]s,&quot; is without historical foundation.

Very little is known about Aristotle's personal appearance except from hostile sources. The statues and busts of Aristotle, possibly from the first years of the Peripatetic School, represent him as sharp and keen of countenance, and somewhat below the average height. His character&amp;mdash;as revealed by his writings, his will (which is undoubtedly genuine), fragments of his letters and the allusions of his unprejudiced contemporaries&amp;mdash;was that of a high-minded, kind-hearted man, devoted to his family and his friends, kind to his slaves, fair to his enemies and rivals, grateful towards his benefactors. When [[Platonism]] ceased to dominate the world of [[Christianity|Christian]] speculation, and the works of Aristotle began to be studied without fear and prejudice, the personality of Aristotle appeared to the Christian writers of the [[13th century]], as it had to the unprejudiced pagan writers of his own day, as calm, majestic, untroubled by passion, and undimmed by any great moral defects, &quot;the master of those who know&quot;.

Aristotle's legacy also had a profound influence on Islamic thought and philosophy during the [[Middle Ages|middle ages]]. The likes of [[Avicenna]], [[Farabi]], and Yaqub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi&lt;small&gt;[http://www.ummah.net/history/scholars/KINDI.html 1]&lt;/small&gt; were a few of the  major proponents of the Aristotelian school of thought during the ''[[Golden Age of Islam]]''.

== Methodology ==
{{details|Aristotle's theory of universals}}
Aristotle defines philosophy in terms of [[essence]], saying that philosophy is &quot;the science of the universal essence of that which is [[actual]]&quot;. Plato had defined it as the &quot;science of the [[idea]]&quot;, meaning by idea what we should call the unconditional basis of [[phenomena]]. Both pupil and master regard philosophy as concerned with the [[universal]]; Aristotle, however, finds the universal in [[particular]] things, and called it the essence of things, while Plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their [[prototype]] or [[exemplar]]. For Aristotle, therefore, philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal ideas to a contemplation of particular imitations of those ideas. In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], while Plato's is essentially deductive.

In Aristotle's terminology, the term ''natural philosophy'' corresponds to the phenomena of the natural world, which include: [[motion]], [[light]], and the [[laws of physics]]. Many centuries later these subjects would become the basis of modern science, as studied through the [[scientific method]]. In modern times the term ''philosophy'' has come to be more narrowly understood as metaphysics, distinct from empirical study of the natural world via the physical sciences.  In contrast, in Aristotle's time and use [[philosophy]] was taken to encompass all facets of intellectual inquiry.

In the larger sense of the word, he makes philosophy coextensive with [[reasoning]], which he also called &quot;science&quot;. Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that which is covered by the scientific method.  &quot;All science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical.&quot; By practical science he understands ethics and politics; by poetical, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; while by theoretical philosophy he means physics, mathematics, and metaphysics.

The last, philosophy in the stricter sense, he defines as &quot;the knowledge of [[immaterial]] being,&quot; and calls it &quot;first philosophy&quot;, &quot;the theologic science&quot; or of &quot;being in the highest degree of abstraction.&quot; If logic, or, as Aristotle calls it, [[Analytic]], be regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, we have as divisions of Aristotelian philosophy (1) [[Logic]]; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including [[Metaphysics]], [[Physics]], [[Mathematics]], (3) Practical Philosophy; and (4) Poetical Philosophy.

==Aristotle's epistemology==
===Logic===
{{main|Aristotelian logic}}
{{see details|Non-Aristotelian logic}}
==== History ====
Aristotle &quot;says that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak about'&quot; (Boche&amp;#324;ski, [[1951]]). However, Plato reports that [[syntax]] was thought of before him, by [[Prodikos of Keos]], who was concerned by the right use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from [[dialectics]]; the earlier philosophers used concepts like ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' as a rule when discussing, but never understood its logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic. Although he had the idea of constructing a system for [[deduction]], he was never able to construct one. Instead, he relied on his [[dialectic]], which was a confusion between different sciences and methods (Boche&amp;#324;ski, [[1951]]). Plato thought that deduction would simply follow from [[premise]]s, so he focused on having good premises so that the [[conclusion]] would follow. Later on, Plato realised that a method for obtaining the conclusion would be beneficial. Plato never obtained such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book ''Sophist'', where he introduced his division method (Rose, [[1968]]).

====Analytics and the ''Organon''====
{{main|Organon}}
What we call today Aristotelian logic, Aristotle himself would have labelled analytics. The term logic he reserved to mean dialectics. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books at about the time of [[Christ]]:
#''Categories''
#''On Interpretation''
#''Prior Analytics''
#''Posterior Analytics''
#''Topics''
#''On Sophistical Refutations''

The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the ''Organon'', namely the fourth book of ''Metaphysics.'' (Boche&amp;#324;ski, 1951).

====Modal logic====
Aristotle is also the creator of [[syllogism]]s with modalities ([[modal logic]]). The word modal refers to the word 'modes', explaining the fact that modal logic deals with the modes of [[truth]]. Aristotle introduced the qualification of 'necessary' and 'possible' premises. He constructed a logic which helped in the evaluation of truth but which was very difficult to interpret. (Rose, 1968).

===Science===
[[Image:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|left|Aristotle, by Francesco Hayez]]
Aristotelian discussions about science had only been qualitative, not quantitative. By the modern definition of the term, Aristotelian philosophy was not science, as this [[worldview]] did not attempt to probe how the world actually worked through [[experiment]]. For example, in his book ''[[History of Animals|The history of animals]]'' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females. Had he only made some observations, he would have discovered that this claim is false.

Rather, based on what one's senses told one, Aristotelian philosophy then depended upon the assumption that man's mind could elucidate all the laws of the universe, based on simple observation (without experimentation) through [[reason]] alone.  

One of the reasons for this was that Aristotle held that physics was about changing objects with a reality of their own, whereas mathematics was about unchanging objects without a reality of their own. In this philosophy, he could not imagine that there was a relationship between them.

In contrast, today's &quot;science&quot; assumes that thinking alone often leads people astray, and therefore one must compare one's ideas to the actual world through experimentation; only then can one see if one's ideas are based in reality. This position is known as [[empiricism]] or the [[scientific method]].

Although Aristotle initiated an important step in the history of scientific method by founding logic as a formal science, he also left behind a trail of bankrupt cosmology that we may discern in selections of the metaphysics. His cosmology would gain much acceptance up until the 1500’s, where Copernicus and Galileo began to figure out that Europe is not the center of the universe. From the 3rd century to the 1500’s, the dominant view held that the earth was the center of the universe: at this late date it is uncontroversial that the earth is not even the center of our own solar system. 

In spite of Aristotle’s bogus account of the planets and sun, he is a vital character in the history of metaphysics, both in terms of the etymology of the word, as well as a figure within metaphysics as a discipline. Dubbed “the stuff next to the physics.” by Andronicus of Rhodes, “metaphysics” became connected to the idea of “beyond the physical” by Simplicius, a commentator on Aristotle. Andronicus had published Aristotle’s works sometime around 43-20 BC; so initially the etymology of metaphysics was simply that which is “next to the physics.”

==Aristotle's metaphysics==

===[[Causality]]===

[[Aristole]] is the first who saw that &quot;All causes of things are beginnings; that we have scientific knowledge when we know the cause; that to know a thing's existence is to know the reason for its existence.&quot;{{fact}}  Setting the guidelines for all the subsequent causal theories, by specifying the number, nature, principles, elements, varieties, order, and modes of causation, Aristotle's account of the causes of things is the most comprehensive theory up to now. According to Aristotle's theory, all the causes fall into several senses, the total number of which amounts to the ways the question 'why' may be answered; namely, by reference to the matter or the ''substratum''; the ''essence'', the pattern, the form, or the structure; to the primary moving ''change'' or the agent and its action; and to the goal, the plan, the ''end'', or the good. Consequently, the major kinds of causes come under the following divisions:

The [[Material Cause]] is that from which a thing comes into existence as from its parts, constituents, substratum or materials. This reduces the explanation of causes to the parts (factors, elements, constituents, ingredients) forming the whole (system, structure, compound, complex, composite, or combination) (the part-whole causation).

The [[Formal Cause]] tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis, or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (macrostructure) is the cause of its parts (the whole-part causation).

The [[Efficient Cause]] is that from which the change or the ending of the change first starts. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of &quot;cause&quot; as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs.

The [[Final Cause]] is that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve, or it is that from which and that to which the change is. This also covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological causes as volition, need, motivation, or motives, rational, irrational, ethical, all that gives purpose to behavior.

Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. [Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or action or influence of cause and effect.] Also, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects, its presence and absent may result in different outcomes.

Besides, Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentiallly, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect

All further investigations of causality will be consisting in imposing the favorite hierarchies on the order causes, like as final &gt; efficient&gt; material &gt; formal (Aquinas), or in restricting all causality to the material and efficient causes or to the efficient causality (deterministic or chance) or just to regular sequences and correlations of natural phenomena (the natural sciences describing how things happen instead of explaining the whys and wherefores).

===Chance and Spontaneity===
Spontaneity and chance are causes of effects. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things. It is &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot; (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of &quot;chance&quot; it might be better to think of &quot;coincidence&quot;: Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place. For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.

However, chance can only apply to human beings, it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, chance must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. &quot;What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance&quot; (Physics, 2.6).

===The Five Elements===
*'''Fire''' which is hot and dry.
*'''Earth''' which is cold and dry.
*'''Air''' which is hot and wet.
*'''Water''' which is cold and wet.
*'''Aether''' which is the divine substance that makes up the heavens

These four elements interchange (i.e. Fire &amp;#x2194; Air &amp;#x2194; Water &amp;#x2194; Earth etc.), while aether is on its own. The Sun keeps this cycle going. God keeps the Sun going (and thus the Sun is eternal).

== Aristotle's ethics ==
{{main|Aristotelian ethics}}
Although Aristotle wrote several works on [[ethics]], the major one was the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', which is considered one of Aristotle's greatest works; it discusses [[virtue]]s. The ten books which comprise it are based on notes from his lectures at the [[Lyceum]] and were either edited by or dedicated to Aristotle's son, [[Nicomachus]].

Aristotle believed that ethical knowledge is not ''certain'' knowledge, like [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]], but ''general knowledge''. Also, as it is a practical discipline rather than a [[theory|theoretical]] one, he thought that in order to become &quot;good,&quot; one could not simply study what virtue ''is''; one must actually do virtuous deeds.  
In order to do this, Aristotle had first to establish what was virtuous.  He began by determining that everything was done with some goal in mind and that goal is 'good.'  The ultimate goal he called the ''Highest Good''.

Aristotle contested that happiness could not be found only in pleasure or only in fame and honor. He finally finds happiness &quot;by ascertaining the specific function of man.&quot; But what is this function that will bring happiness?  To determine this, Aristotle analyzed the soul and found it to have three parts: the Nutritive Soul (plants, animals and humans), the Perceptive Soul (animals and humans) and the Rational Soul (humans only).  Thus, a human's function is to do what makes it human, to be good at what sets it apart from everything else: the ability to reason or ''Nous''. A person that does this is the happiest because they are fulfilling their purpose or nature as found in the rational soul.  Depending on how well they did this, Aristotle said people belonged to one of four categories: the Virtuous, the Continent, the Incontinent and the Vicious.

Aristotle believes that every ethical virtue is an intermediate condition between [[excess]] and [[deficiency]]. This does not mean Aristotle believed in moral relativism, however.  He set certain emotions (e.g., hate, envy, jealousy, spite, etc.) and certain actions (e.g., adultery, theft, murder, etc.) as always wrong, regardless of the situation or the circumstances.

===Nicomachean ethics===
{{main|Nicomachean Ethics}}
In ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Aristotle focuses on the importance of continually [[behavior|behaving]] virtuously and developing [[virtue]] rather than committing specific good actions. This can be contrasted with [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] ethics, in which the primary focus is on individual action. ''Nicomachean Ethics'' emphasizes the importance of context to ethical behaviour &amp;mdash; what might be right in one situation might be wrong in another. Aristotle believed that [[happiness]] is the end of life and that as long as a person is striving for [[Goodness and value theory|goodness]], good deeds will result from that struggle, making the person virtuous and therefore happy.

== Aristotle's critics ==
[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plato]] (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of ''[[Raphael Rooms|The School of Athens]]'', a fresco by [[Raphael]].  Aristotle gestures to the earth, representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience, whilst Plato points up to the heavens showing his belief in the ultimate truth.]]

Aristotle has been criticised on several grounds.

* His analysis of procreation is frequently criticised on the grounds that it presupposes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive, lumpen female element; it is on these grounds that some feminist critics refer to Aristotle as a misogynist. 
*At times, the objections that Aristotle raises against the arguments of his own teacher, [[Plato]], appear to rely on faulty interpretations of those arguments.
*Although Aristotle advised, against Plato, that knowledge of the world could only be obtained through experience, he frequently failed to take his own advice. Aristotle conducted projects of careful [[empirical]] investigation, but often drifted into [[Abstraction|abstract]] logical reasoning, with the result that his work was littered with conclusions that were not supported by empirical evidence: for example, his assertion that objects of different [[mass]] fall at different speeds under [[gravity]], which was later refuted by [[John Philoponus]] (credit is often given to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], even though Philopinus lived centuries earlier).
*In the [[Middle Ages]], roughly from the [[12th century]] to the [[15th century]], the philosophy of Aristotle became firmly established [[dogma]]. Although Aristotle himself was far from dogmatic in his approach to philosophical inquiry, two aspects of his philosophy might have assisted its transformation into dogma. His works were wide-ranging and [[systematic]] so that they could give the impression that no significant matter had been left unsettled. He was also much less inclined to employ the [[skeptic]]al methods of his predecessors, Socrates and Plato.
*Some academics have suggested that Aristotle was unaware of much of the current science of his own time.

Aristotle was called not a great philosopher, but &quot;The Philosopher&quot; by [[Scholastic]] thinkers. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods.

== The loss of his works ==
Though we know that Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises ([[Cicero]] described his literary style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;), the originals have been lost in time. All that we have now are the literary notes for his pupils, which are often difficult to read (the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' is a good example). It is now believed that we have about one fifth of his original works.

Aristotle underestimated the importance of his written work for humanity. He thus never published his books, except from his dialogues. The story of the original manuscripts of his treatises is described by [[Strabo]] in his Geography and [[Plutarch]] in his &quot;[[Parallel Lives]], Sulla&quot;: The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to [[Theophrastus]], from Theophrastus to [[Neleus of Scepsis]], from Neleus to his heirs. Their descendants sold them to [[Apellicon of Teos]]. When [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] occupied Athens in [[86 BC]], he carried off the library of Appellicon to [[Rome]], where they were first published in [[60 BC]] from the grammarian [[Tyrranion of Amisus]] and then by philosopher [[Andronicus of Rhodes]].

== Bibliography ==
''Note: [[Bekker numbers]] are often used to uniquely identify passages of Aristotle. They are identified below where available.''

=== Major works ===
The extant works of Aristotle are broken down according to the five categories in the ''[[Corpus Aristotelicum]]''. Not all of these works are considered genuine, but differ with respect to their connection to Aristotle, his associates and his views. Some, such as the ''Athenaion Politeia'' or the fragments of other ''politeia'' are regarded by most scholars as products of Aristotle's &quot;school&quot; and compiled under his direction or supervision. Other works, such ''On Colours'' may have been products of Aristotle's successors at the Lyceum, e.g., [[Theophrastus]] and [[Straton]]. Still others acquired Aristotle's name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the ''De Plantis,'' possibly by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]. A final category, omitted here, includes medieval [[palmistries]], [[astrological]] and [[magical]] texts whose connection to Aristotle is purely fanciful and self-promotional. Those that are seriously disputed are marked with an asterisk.

      <text xml:space="preserve">: '' ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American In Paris]]'' is also a 1951 film musical starring [[Gene Kelly]].''

'''''An American in Paris''''' is a [[European-influenced classical music|symphonic]] composition by [[United States|American]] composer [[George Gershwin]] which debuted in [[1928]].  Inspired by Gershwin's time in [[Paris]], it is in the form of an extended [[tone poem]] evoking the sights and energy of the [[France|French]] capital in the [[1920s]].  In addition to the standard instruments of the [[symphony orchestra]], the score features period automobile horns; Gershwin brought back some Parisian taxi-cab horns for the New York premiere of the composition.  

* &quot;An American In Paris&quot; is second only to [[Rhapsody In Blue]] as a favorite of Gershwin's classical compositions.

* The score also features instruments rarely seen in the concert hall: [[celesta]] and [[saxophone]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Academy Awards''', popularly known as the '''Oscars''', are the most prominent [[film]] awards in the [[United States]] and arguably the world.  The Awards are granted by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], a professional honorary organization which, [[as of 2003]], had a voting membership of 5,816.  Actors (with a membership of 1,311) make up the largest voting bloc.  The votes have been tabulated and certified by auditing firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] since close to the awards' inception. [http://www.pwc.com/extweb/newcolth.nsf/docid/540E0FBE1B2997EE85256E55005BE8FB]

The [[78th Academy Awards|next Oscars]] will take place on Sunday, [[March 5th]], [[2006]].

==Oscar statuette==
The official name of the Oscar [[statuette]] is the &quot;Academy Award of Merit.&quot; Made of [[gold]]-plated [[britannium]] on a black marble base, it is 13.5 inches (34 cm) tall, weighs 8.5 lbs (3.85 kg) and depicts a [[knight]] holding a [[crusade|crusader]]'s [[sword]] standing on a [[reel]] of film. The root of the name &quot;Oscar&quot; is contested. Some believe it comes from Academy librarian [[Margaret Herrick]], who saw it on a table and said, &quot;it looks just like my uncle Oscar!&quot; Others claim that [[Bette Davis]] named it after her first husband. However it became, the nickname stuck and is used almost as commonly as ''Academy Award'', even by the Academy itself. In fact, the Academy's domain name is ''oscars.org'' and the official website for the Academy Awards is at ''oscar.com''.

==Awards night==
The major awards are given out at a ceremony, most commonly in March following the relevant calendar year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent [[fashion]] designers of the day. The ceremony and extravagant afterparties, including the Academy's Governors Ball, are televised around the world.

The ceremony has consecutively aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] since 1976.

==Nominations==
Today, according to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film has to open in the previous calendar year (from [[midnight]] [[January 1]] to midnight [[December 31]]) in [[Los Angeles County, California]], to qualify. [http://www.oscars.org/78academyawards/rules/index.html]  Rule 2 states that a film must be &quot;feature-length&quot; (defined as 40 minutes) to qualify for an award (except for Short Subject awards, of course). It must also exist either on a [[35 mm film|35mm]] or [[70 mm film|70mm]] film print OR on a 24fps or 48fps [[progressive scan]] [[digital film]] print with a native resolution no lower than [[SXGA|1280x1024]].

The members of the various branches nominate those in their respective fields (actors are nominated by the actors' branch, etc.) while all members may submit nominees for Best Picture. The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are now allowed to vote in all categories.

==Membership==
Academy membership may be obtained by one of two ways: a competitive nomination (however, the nominee must be invited to join) or a member may submit a name, seconded by at least two other members, then voted upon by the Board of Governors. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although past press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. If a person not yet a member is nominated in more than one category in a single year, he/she must choose which branch to join when he/she accepts membership.

[[Image:Animalia.jpg|thumb|120px|Animalia Cover.]]'''Animalia''' is an illustrated [[Children's literature|children's book]] by [[Graeme Base]].  It was published in [[1986]].  

Animalia is an alphabet book and contains twenty six illustrations, one for each letter of the alphabet.  Each illustration features an animal from the animal kingdom (A is for [[alligator]], B is for [[butterfly]], etc).  The illustrations contain dozens of small objects that the curious reader can try to identify.

Base also published a [[coloring book]] version [http://www.alibris.com/search/search.cfm?qwork=7937230&amp;wauth=Base%2C%20Graeme&amp;matches=16&amp;qsort=r&amp;cm_re=works*listing*title] for children to do their own coloring.

      <comment>utc disambig</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Temps Atomique International''' ('''TAI''') or '''International Atomic Time''' is a very accurate and stable [[time scale]].  It is a weighted average of the time kept by about 300 [[atomic clock]]s (including a large number of  [[caesium]] atomic clocks) in over 50 national laboratories worldwide.  It has been available since [[1955]], and became the international standard on which [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] is based on [[January 1]], [[1972]], as decided by the 14th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM). The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] is in charge of the realization of TAI.

The highest precision realization of TAI times can only be determined retrospectively, as the timescale is defined by periodic comparisons among its participating atomic clocks. However, these corrections are usually only needed for applications that require nanosecond-scale accuracy.  Most time service users use realtime estimates of TAI provided by atomic clocks that have been previously referenced to the composite timescale.  [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] is a commonly-used realtime source of time traceable back to TAI.

[[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) is the basis for legal time throughout much of the world, and always differs from TAI by an integral number of seconds.  From [[1 January]] [[2006]], UTC was behind TAI by 33 seconds.  The difference is due to an initial ten second offset on [[1 January]] [[1972]] when UTC was established and [[leap second]]s, which have been periodically inserted into UTC since the first on [[30 June]] [[1972]] due to slight irregularities in Earth's rate of rotation.  While TAI is a continuous and stable timescale, UTC has intentional discontinuities to keep it from drifting more than 0.9 second from [[UT1]], a timescale defined by the Earth's rotation.  Roughly speaking, solar noon (the time at which the sun is directly overhead) would drift away from 12:00:00 without leap second corrections.  UT1 is computed by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS).  TAI was defined such that TAI = [[UT2]] on [[January 1]] [[1958]].  

Because UTC is a discontinuous timescale, it is not possible to compute the exact time interval elapsed between two UTC timestamps without consulting a table that describes how many leap seconds occurred during that interval.  Therefore, many scientific applications that require precise measurement of long (multi-year) intervals use TAI instead.  TAI is also commonly used by systems that can not handle leap seconds.

      <comment>/* Altruism and religion */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Altruism''' is considered a belief, a practice, a habit, or an [[ethics|ethical doctrine]]. Many cultures and religious traditions judge altruism to be [[virtue|virtuous]]. In English, the idea was often described as [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden rule of ethics]]. In [[Buddhism]] it is considered a fundamental property of [[human nature]].

''Altruism'' can refer to:

* being helpful to other people with little or no interest in being rewarded for one's efforts (the colloquial definition). This is distinct from merely helping others.

* actions that benefit others with a net detrimental or neutral effect on the actor, regardless of the actor's own psychology, motivation, or the cause of his or her actions. This type of altruistic behavior is referred to in [[ecology]] as ''[[Commensalism]]''.

* an ethical doctrine that holds that individuals have a moral obligation to help others, if necessary to the exclusion of one's own interest or benefit. One who holds such a doctrine is known as an &quot;altruist.&quot;

The concepts have a long history in [[philosophical]] and [[ethical]] thought, and have more recently become a topic for [[psychologists]], [[sociologists]], [[evolution]]ary biologists, and [[ethology|ethologists]]. While ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields lead to different perspectives on altruism.

Altruism can be distinguished from a feeling of [[loyalty]] and [[duty]]. Altruism focuses on a moral obligation towards all [[humanity]], while duty focuses on a moral obligation towards a specific individual (e.g. a [[king]]), a specific organization (e.g. a [[government]]), or an abstract concept (e.g. [[God]], [[country]] etc). Some individuals may feel both altruism and duty, while others may not. As opposed to altruism, duty is much easier to enforce by an [[authority]].

==Altruism in ethics==
''Main article: [[Altruism (ethical doctrine)]]''

The word &quot;altruism&quot; (''French, altruisme, from autrui: &quot;other people&quot;, derived from Latin alter: &quot;other&quot;'') was coined by [[Auguste Comte]], the French founder of [[positivism]], in order to describe the ethical doctrine he supported. He believed that individuals had a moral obligation to serve the interest of others or the &quot;greater good&quot; of humanity. Comte says, in his Catechisme Positiviste, that ''&quot;[the] social point of view cannot tolerate the notion of rights, for such notion rests on individualism. We are born under a load of obligations of every kind, to our predecessors, to our successors, to our contemporaries. After our birth these obligations increase or accumulate, for it is some time before we can return any service.... This [&quot;to live for others&quot;], the definitive formula of human morality, gives a direct sanction exclusively to our instincts of benevolence, the common source of happiness and duty. [Man must serve] Humanity, whose we are entirely.&quot;'' As the name of the ethical doctrine is &quot;altruism,&quot; doing what the ethical doctrine prescribes has also come to be referred to by the term &quot;altruism&quot; -- serving others through placing their interests above one's own.

However, the idea that one has a moral obligation to serve others is much older than Auguste Comte. For example, many of the world's oldest and most widespread [[religion]]s (particularly [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]]) advocate it. In the [[New Testament]] of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]], it is explained as follows:
:&quot;Jesus made answer and said, ''A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion, and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on [them] oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow he took out two shillings, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee.'' Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers? And he said, He that showed mercy on him. And Jesus said unto him, '''Go, and do thou likewise.'''&quot; ''(Luke 10: 30-37)''

Philosophers who support [[ethical egoism|egoism]] have argued that altruism is demeaning to the individual and that no moral obligation to help others actually exists. [[Nietzsche]] asserts that altruism is predicated on the assumption that others are more important than one's self and that such a position is degrading and demeaning. He also claims that it was very uncommon for people in Europe to consider the sacrifice of one's own interests for others as virtuous until after the advent of Christianity. [[Ayn Rand]] argued that altruism is the willful sacrifice of one's values, and represents the reversal of morality because only a rationally selfish ethics allows one to pursue the values required for human life.

Advocates of altruism as an ethical doctrine maintain that one ought to act, or refrain from acting, so that benefit or [[good (economics)|good]] is bestowed on other people, if necessary to the exclusion of one's own interests (Note that refraining from murdering someone, for example, is not altruism since he is not receiving a benefit or being helped, as he already has his life; this would amount to the same thing as ignoring someone).

==Altruism in ethology and evolutionary biology==
In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of behavior), altruism refers to behavior by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor. This would appear to be counter-intuitive if one presumes that [[natural selection]] acts on the individual. Natural selection, however, acts on the gene pool of the subjects, not on each subject individually. Recent developments in [[game theory]] have provided some explanations for apparent altruism, as have traditional evolutionary analyses. Among the proposed mechanisms are:

* [[Behavioral manipulation]] (e.g., by certain [[parasites]] that can alter the behavior of the host, see [http://news.yahoo.com/s/space/20060211/sc_space/mindcontrolbyparasites])
* [[Bounded rationality]] (e.g., [[Herbert Simon]])
* [[Conscience]]
* [[Indirect reciprocity]] (e.g., [[reputation]])
* [[Kin selection]] including [[eusociality]] (see also &quot;[[selfish gene]]&quot;)
* [[Meme]]s (by influencing behavior to favour their own spread, e.g.,  [[religion]])
* [[Reciprocal altruism]], mutual aid
* [[Sexual selection]]
* [[Strong reciprocity]]

The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[George R. Price]]'s development of the [[Price equation]] which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides''. These protists live as individual [[amoebae]] until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body. Social behavior and altruism share many similaraties to the interactions between the many parts (cells, genes) of an organism, but are distinguished by the ability of each individual to reproduce indefinitely without an absolute requirement for its neighbors.

==Altruism in psychology and sociology==
If one performs an act beneficial to others with a view to gaining some personal benefit, then it is not an altruistically motivated act. There are several different perspectives on how &quot;benefit&quot; (or &quot;interest&quot;) should be defined. A material gain (e.g. money, a physical reward, etc.) is clearly a form of benefit, while others identify and include both material and immaterial gains (affection, respect, happiness, satisfaction etc.) as being philosophically identical benefits.

According to ''[[psychological egoism]]'', while people can exhibit altruistic ''behavior'', they cannot have altruistic ''motivations''. Psychological egoists would say that while they might very well spend their lives benefitting others with no material benefit (or a material net loss) to themselves, their most basic motive for doing so is always to further their own interests. For example, it would be alleged that the foundational motive behind a person acting this way is to advance their own psychological well-being (&quot;good feeling&quot;). Critics of this theory often reject it on the grounds that it is [[falsifiability|non-falsifiable]]; in other words, it is designed in such a way as to be impossible to prove or disprove - because immaterial gains such as a &quot;good feeling&quot; cannot be measured or proven to exist in all people performing altruistic acts. Psychological egoism has also been accused of using [[circular logic]]: &quot;If a person willingly performs an act, that means he derives personal enjoyment from it; therefore, people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment&quot;. This statement is circular because its conclusion is identical to its hypothesis (it assumes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment, and concludes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment).

In contrast to psychological egoism, the ''[[empathy-altruism]]'' hypothesis states that when an individual experiences empathy towards someone in need, the individual will then be altruistically motivated to help that person; that is, the individual will be primarily concerned about that person's welfare, not his or her own.  

In common parlance, altruism usually means helping another person without expecting material reward from that or other persons, although it may well entail the &quot;internal&quot; benefit of a &quot;good feeling,&quot; sense of satisfaction, self-esteem, fulfillment of duty (whether imposed by a religion or ideology or simply one's conscience), or the like. In this way one need not speculate on the motives of the altruist in question.

Humans are not exclusively altruistic towards family members, previous co-operators or potential future allies, but can be altruistic towards people they don't know and will never meet.  For example, humans donate to international [[charity|charities]] and volunteer their time to help [[society]]'s less fortunate. 

It strains plausibility to claim that these altruistic deeds are done in the hope of a return favor. The game theory analysis of this 'just in case' strategy, where the principle would be 'always help everyone in case you need to pull in a favor in return', is a decidedly ''non-optimal'' strategy, where the net expenditure of effort (tit) is far greater than the net profit when it occasionally pays off (tat). 

According to some, it is difficult to believe that these behaviors are solely explained as indirect selfish [[rationality]], be it conscious or sub-conscious. Mathematical formulations of [[kin selection]], along the lines of the [[prisoner's dilemma]], are helpful as far as they go; but what a [[game theory|game-theoretic]] explanation glosses over is the fact that altruistic behavior can be attributed to that apparently mysterious phenomenon, the [[conscience]]. One recent suggestion, proposed by the philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], was initially developed when considering the problem of so-called 'free riders' in the [[tragedy of the commons]], a larger-scale version of the [[prisoner's dilemma]].

In [[game theory]] terms, a free rider is an [[agent (grammar)|agent]] who draws benefits from a co-operative society without contributing. In a one-to-one situation, free riding can easily be discouraged by a tit-for-tat strategy. But in a larger-scale society, where contributions and benefits are pooled and shared, they can be incredibly difficult to shake off. 

Imagine an elementary society of co-operative organisms. Co-operative agents interact with each other, each contributing resources and each drawing on the common good. Now imagine a [[rogue]] [[free rider]], an agent who draws a favor (&quot;you scratch my back&quot;) and later refuses to return it. The problem is that free riding is always going to be beneficial to individuals at cost to society. How can well-behaved co-operative agents avoid being cheated? Over many generations, one obvious solution is for co-operators to evolve the ability to spot potential free riders in advance and refuse to enter into [[reciprocal]] arrangements with them. Then, the canonical free rider response is to evolve a more convincing [[disguise]], fooling co-operators into co-operating after all. This can lead to an evolutionary [[arms race]]s, with ever-more-sophisticated disguises and ever-more-sophisticated detectors.

In this evolutionary arms race, how best might one convince comrades that one ''really is'' a genuine co-operator, not a free rider in disguise?  One answer is by ''actually making oneself'' a  genuine co-operator, by erecting [[psychological barriers]] to breaking promises, and by advertising this fact to everyone else. In other words, a good solution is for organisms to evolve things that everyone knows will force them to be co-operators - and to make it obvious that they've evolved these things. So evolution will produce organisms who are sincerely moral and who wear their hearts on their sleeves; in short, evolution will give rise to the phenomenon of conscience. 

This theory, combined with ideas of [[kin selection]] and the one-to-one sharing of benefits, may explain how a blind and fundamentally selfish process can produce a genuinely non-cynical form of altruism that gives rise to the human conscience.

Critics of such technical game theory analysis point out that it appears to forget that human beings are rational and emotional. To presume an analysis of human behaviour without including human rationale or emotion is necessarily unrealistically narrow, and treats human beings as if they are mere machines, sometimes called [[Homo economicus]]. Another objection is that often people donate anonymously, so that it is impossible to determine if they really did the altruistic act.

Beginning with an understanding that rational human beings benefit from living in a benign universe, logically it follows that particular human beings may gain substantial emotional satisfaction from acts which they perceive to make the world a better place.

== Comparison of Altruism and Tit for Tat ==
Studying the simple strategy &quot;[[Tit for tat]]&quot; in the 
[[iterated prisoner's dilemma]] problem, [[game theory|game theorists]] argue that 
&quot;Tit for tat&quot; is much more successful in establishing stable [[cooperation]] among
individuals than altruism, defined as ''unconditional'' cooperation, can ever be. 

&quot;Tit for tat&quot; starts with cooperation in the first
step (as altruism does) and then just imitates the behaviour of the partner step by step. If the partner
cooperates, then he ''rewards'' him with cooperation, if he doesn't, then he 
''punishes'' him by not cooperating in the next step. 

Confronted with many strategies that try to exploit or abuse cooperation of others, this 
simple strategy surprisingly proved to be the most successful (see [[The Evolution of Cooperation]]). 
It was even more successful than these abusing strategies, while unconditional cooperativity (altruism) was
one of the most unsuccessful strategies.  
Confronted with altruistic behaviour, Tit for tat is indistinguishable from 
pure altruism. [[Robert Axelrod]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] also showed that 
altruism may be harmful to society by nourishing exploiters and abusers (and making them more and
more powerful until they can force everyone to cooperate unconditionally), which
is not the case for &quot;Tit for tat&quot;. (See also comparison of [[entrepreneur]] and [[entredonneur]])

In the context of [[biology]], the &quot;Tit for tat&quot; strategy is also called [[reciprocal altruism]].

==Altruism in politics==
&lt;table border&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td colspan='2' align='center'&gt;'''There is currently a [[WP:NPOV|POV]] [[WP:DR|dispute]] as to the wording of the section shown below.'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign='top'&gt;
If one is an adherent to the ''ethical doctrine'' called altruism (that people have an ethical obligation to help or further the welfare of others), then one will support the kind of politics that one believes to be most effective in furthering the welfare of others, regardless of the effect this may have on oneself. Since there is no general consensus on what kind of politics results in the greatest benefit for others, different altruists may have very different political views.

With regard to their political convictions, altruists may be divided in two broad groups: Those who believe altruism is a matter of personal choice (and therefore selfishness can and should be tolerated), and those who believe that altruism is a moral ideal which should be embraced, if possible, by all human beings.

A prominent example of the former branch of altruist political thought is [[Lysander Spooner]], who, in ''Natural Law'', writes: &quot;''Man, no doubt, owes many other moral duties to his fellow men; such as to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, shelter the homeless, care for the sick, protect the defenceless, assist the weak, and enlighten the ignorant. But these are simply moral duties, of which each man must be his own judge, in each particular case, as to whether, and how, and how far, he can, or will, perform them.''&quot;

The latter branch of altruist political thought, on the other hand, argues that [[egoism]] should be actively discouraged, and that altruists have a duty not only to help other people, but to teach those people to help each other as well. Thus, in politics, these altruists almost always take a [[left-wing]] stance, ranging from moderate [[social democracy]] to [[socialism]] or even [[communism]]. Moderate altruists of this branch may argue for the creation of [[tax|taxation-funded]] government programs aimed at benefiting the needy (for example [[transfer payments]], such as [[social welfare]], or [[public healthcare]] and [[public education]]). Less obvious things such as a law that motorists pull over to let emergency vehicles pass may also be justified by appealing to the altruism ethic. Finally, radical altruists of this branch may take things further and advocate some form of [[collectivism]] or [[communalism]].

On a somewhat related note, altruism is often held - even by non-altruists - to be the kind of ethic that should guide the actions of politicians and other people in positions of power. Such people are usually expected to set their own interests aside and serve the populace. When they do not, they may be criticized as defaulting on what is believed to be an ethical obligation to place the interests of others above their own.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign='top'&gt;
Politicians often speak of a moral obligation of individuals to help others. For example, [[George Bush]], speaking to the [[United Nations]] said: &quot;We have a moral obligation to help others -- and a moral duty to make sure our actions are effective.&quot;

If one is an adherent to the ''ethical doctrine'' called altruism (that people have an ethical obligation to help or further the welfare of others), it can become a moral justification for forcing, or advocating forcing individuals to help others. In the realm of politics, the altruist may employ an agent in the form of [[government]] to enforce this supposed moral obligation. This is not to say that an ethical altruist will ''necessarily'' force this on anyone. An altruist may allow others the freedom to behave in a manner they believe to be immoral or selfish. In other words, their ethical doctrine would not manifest itself politically.

With regard those who believe benevolence is a moral obligation, altruists may be divided in two broad groups: Those who believe helping others is a moral obligation but should not be enforced on individuals. And, those who believe that since helping others is a moral obligation, forcing individuals to help others if they are not willing on their own is justified.

A prominent example of the former branch of altruist political thought is [[Lysander Spooner]], who, in ''Natural Law'', writes: &quot;''Man, no doubt, owes many other moral duties to his fellow men; such as to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, shelter the homeless, care for the sick, protect the defenceless, assist the weak, and enlighten the ignorant. But these are simply moral duties, of which each man must be his own judge, in each particular case, as to whether, and how, and how far, he can, or will, perform them.''&quot; 

The latter branch of altruist political thought, on the other hand, argues that [[egoism]] should be actively discouraged, and that individuals should be forced to help other people. Thus, in politics, these altruists almost always take a [[left-wing]] stance, ranging from moderate [[social democracy]] to [[socialism]] or even [[communism]]. Moderate altruists of this branch may argue for the creation of [[tax|taxation-funded]] government programs aimed at benefiting the needy (for example [[transfer payments]], such as [[social welfare]], or [[public healthcare]] and [[public education]]). Finally, radical altruists of this branch may take things to an extreme and advocate some form of state-enforced [[collectivism]], [[communalism]], or communism. This is in line with August Comte's philosophy (who coined the term altruism), which argues against individual rights.

Finally, many believe that helping others or serving society is not a moral obligation at all, but that altrusm is an arbitrary pronouncement not philosophically derivable. These oppose all government-enforced charity. [[Individualist anarchist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in 1847 warns of enforcing charity: &quot;That is why charity, the prime virtue of the Christian, the legitimate hope of the socialist, the object of all the efforts of the economist, is a social vice the moment it is made a principle of constitution and a law; that is why certain economists have been able to say that legal charity had caused more evil in society than proprietary usurpation&quot; (''The Philosophy of Poverty'').

Comte asserts that individual rights are not compatible with the supposed obligation to serve others. Some argue that the ethical doctrine, if taken to its logical conclusion, leads to tyranny.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Altruism and religion==
{{sect-stub}}
All the major world [[religion]]s promote altruism as a very important moral value. [[Christianity]] and [[Buddhism]] place particular emphasis on altruistic morality, as noted above, but [[Judaism]], [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]] also promote altruistic behavior.
The [[Good Samaritan]] is a famous [[New Testament]] parable appearing only in the [[Gospel of Luke]] (10:25-37). The parable is told by [[Jesus]] illustrating altruism.
 &lt;!-- This section should continue by quoting altruism-related verses from the holy books of the aforementioned religions --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Ang_lee.jpg|frame|Lee accepting the Best Foreign Film award for ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' at the 73rd Academy Awards]]
'''Ang Lee''' (Chinese: 李安; Pinyin: Lǐ Ān ) (born [[October 23]], [[1954]]) is an [[Academy Award]]-winning [[film director]]  from [[Taiwan]].

==Early life==
Ang Lee was born and raised in [[Pingtung County|Pingtung, Taiwan]] and educated in the [[United States]], where he found success as a [[Hollywood]] director, well-known for his [[wuxia]] film ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]''  (2000).

He completed his bachelor's degree in Theater from the [[University of Illinois]] and received his [[MFA]] from [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], where in 1984 he made a thesis film called ''Fine Line''. He was a classmate of [[Spike Lee]] and worked on the crew of the latter Lee's thesis film, ''Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads''. 

==Career==
Many of his films have focused on the interactions between modernity and tradition. His films have also tended to have a light-hearted comic tone which marks a break from the tragic historical realism which characterized Taiwanese filmmaking after the end of the martial law period in 1987. Lee's films also tend to draw on deep secrets and internal torment that begin to come to the surface such as the gay-themed films ''[[The Wedding Banquet]]'' (1993), ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005), the martial arts epic ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (2000) and the comic book adaptation ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' (2003)

He received the Dartmouth Film Award in 2002, along with [[Meryl Streep]].

Lee's film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005) won the best film award at the Venice International Film Festival and was named 2005's best film by the Los Angeles film critics. It also won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Motion Picture — Drama, with Lee winning the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Director. Lee also won the Best Director award for the film at the 2006 British Academy Awards (BAFTAs). In January 2006, Brokeback scored a leading 8 [[Academy Award]] nominations including Lee for Best Director.  The film is considered to be the frontrunner for the March 5, 2006 ceremony.  He taught [[Meryl Streep]]'s son and [[Kai Christophe Wong]], initially scheduled for the lead in ''[[Dark Matter]]''.

==Private life==
His wife, Jane, is a microbiologist; they have two children, Haan and Mason.
He is a huge fan of the [[Vancouver Canucks]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. He kept his directing aspirations a secret because his culture did not encourage ambitions in a non-practical career like film.

'''Ayn Rand''' ({{IPA2|ajn ɹænd}}, {{OldStyleDate|February 2|1905|January 20}} &amp;ndash; [[March 6]] [[1982]]), born '''Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum''', was best known for her [[philosophy]] of [[Objectivist philosophy|Objectivism]] and her novels ''[[We the Living]]'', ''[[Anthem (novel)|Anthem]]'', ''[[The Fountainhead]]'', and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Her philosophy and her fiction both emphasize, above all, the concepts of [[individualism]], rational [[egoism]] (&quot;[[Objectivist ethics|rational self-interest]]&quot;), and [[capitalism]], which she believed should be implemented fully via ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]]. Her politics has been described as [[minarchism]] and [[libertarianism]], though she never used the first term and detested the second.

Her novels were based upon the projection of the Randian [[hero]], a man whose ability and independence causes conflict with the masses, but who perseveres nevertheless to achieve his values. Rand viewed this hero as the ideal, and the express goal of her fiction was to showcase such heroes. 

She believed:
*That man must choose his values and actions by reason; 
*That the individual has a right to exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing self to others nor others to self; and 
*That no one has the right to seek values from others by physical force, or impose ideas on others by physical force.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rand was born in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], and was the eldest of three daughters of a [[Jew]]ish family. Her parents were [[agnostic]] and largely non-observant. From an early age, she displayed a strong interest in literature and films. She started writing screenplays and novels from the age of seven. Her mother taught her French and subscribed to a magazine featuring stories for boys, where Rand found her first childhood hero: Cyrus Paltons, an Indian army officer in a [[Rudyard Kipling]]-style story called &quot;The Mysterious Valley&quot;. Throughout her youth, she read the novels of [[Sir Walter Scott]], [[Alexandre Dumas]] and other Romantic writers, and expressed a passionate enthusiasm toward the Romantic movement as a whole. She discovered [[Victor Hugo]] at the age of thirteen, and fell deeply in love with his novels. Later, she cited him as her favorite novelist and the greatest novelist of world literature. She studied philosophy and history at the [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of Petrograd]]. Her major literary discoveries in university were the works of [[Edmond Rostand]], [[Friedrich Schiller]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]. She admired Rostand for his richly romantic imagination and Schiller for his grand, heroic scale. She admired Dostoevsky for his sense of drama and his intense moral judgments, but was deeply against his philosophy and his sense of life. She continued to write short stories and screenplays and wrote sporadically in her diary, which contained intensely anti-Soviet ideas. She also encountered the philosophical ideas of [[Nietzsche]], and loved his exaltation of the heroic and independent individual who embraced egoism and rejected altruism in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. Though an early fan of Nietzsche, she eventually became critical, seeing his philosophy as emphasizing emotion over reason. Nevertheless, as Allan Gotthelf points out in book ''On Ayn Rand'', &quot;the influence was real.&quot; She did still retain an admiration for some of his ideas, and quoted Nietzsche in the introduction to the 25th aniversary edition of ''The Fountainhead'': &quot;''The noble soul has reverence for itself.''&quot; Her greatest influence by far is [[Aristotle]], especially ''Organon (Logic)''. Although Leonard Peikoff, promoter of her ideas, says she is the greatest philosopher who ever lived, she herself considered Aristotle the greatest philosopher ever, and stated that he was the only philosopher who had influenced her (this is probably because, as she has stated, she did not include her own work when analyzing the culture.) She then entered the State Institute for Cinema Arts in 1924 to study screenwriting; in late 1925, however, she was granted a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to visit American relatives. She arrived in the [[United States]] in February 1926, at the age of twenty-one. After a brief stay with her relatives in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], she resolved never to return to the [[Soviet Union]], and set out for [[Hollywood]] to become a [[screenwriter]]. She then changed her name to &quot;Ayn Rand&quot;. There is a story told that she named herself after the [[Remington Rand]] [[typewriter]], but she began using the name Ayn Rand before the typewriter was first sold. She stated that her first name, 'Ayn', was an adaptation of the name of a Finnish writer. This may have been the Finnish-Estonian author [[Aino Kallas]], but variations of this name are common in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]-speaking regions.

===Major works===
Initially, Rand struggled in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses. While working as an [[extra (drama)|extra]] on [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The King of Kings|King of Kings]]'', she intentionally bumped into an aspiring young actor, [[Frank O'Connor (actor)|Frank O'Connor]], who caught her eye. The two married in 1929. In 1931, Rand became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. Her first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay ''[[Red Pawn]]'' in 1932 to [[Universal Studios]]. Rand then wrote the play ''[[The Night of January 16th]]'' in 1934, which was highly successful, and published two novels, ''[[We the Living]]'' (1936), and ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' (1938). While ''We the Living'' met with mixed reviews in the U.S. and positive reviews in the U.K., ''Anthem'' received significiant and positive reviews only in England, due in part to its odd publication history.  She was up against [[The Red Decade ]] in America, and ''Anthem'' did not even find a publisher in the United States; it was first published in England. Besides, Rand had still not perfected her literary style and these novels cannot be considered representative.

Without Rand's knowledge or permission, ''[[We The Living]]'' was made into a pair of films, ''Noi vivi'' and ''Addio, Kira'' in 1942 by Scalara Films, [[Rome]]. They were nearly censored by the [[Italy|Italian]] government under [[Benito Mussolini]], but they were permitted because the novel upon which they were based was anti-Soviet. The films were successful and the public easily realized that they were as much against Fascism as Communism, and the government banned them quickly  thereafter. These films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as ''We the Living'' in 1986.

Rand's first major professional success came with her best-selling novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' (1943), which she wrote over a period of seven years. The novel was rejected by twelve publishers, who thought it was too intellectual and opposed to the mainstream of American thought. It was finally accepted by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] publishing house, thanks mainly to a member of the editorial board, Archibald Ogden, who praised the book in the highest terms and finally prevailed.  Eventually, ''The Fountainhead'' was a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security.

The theme of ''The Fountainhead'' is &quot;individualism and collectivism in man's soul&quot;. It features the lives of five main characters. The hero, Howard Roark, is Rand's ideal, a noble soul ''par excellence'', an architect who is firmly and serenely devoted to his own ideals and believes that no man should copy the style of another in any field, especially architecture. All the other characters in the novel demand that he renounce his values, but Roark maintains his integrity. Unlike traditional heroes who launch into long and passionate monologues about their integrity and the unfairness of the world; Roark, in contrast, does it with a disdainful, almost contemptuous taciturnity and laconicism.

Rand's [[magnum opus]], ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', was published in 1957, becoming an international bestseller. ''Atlas Shrugged'' is often seen as Rand's most complete statement of the [[Objectivist philosophy]] in any of her works of fiction. In its appendix, she offered this summary:
:&quot;My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.&quot;

The theme of ''Atlas Shrugged'' is &quot;The role of man's mind in society&quot;. Rand upheld the industrialist as one of the most admirable members of any society and fiercely opposed the popular resentment accorded to industrialists. This led her to envision a novel wherein the industrialists of America go on strike and retreat to a mountainous hideaway. The American economy and its society in general slowly start to collapse. The government responds by increasing the already stifling controls on industrial concerns. The novel deals with issues as complex and divergent as sex, music, medicine, politics, and human ability.

Along with [[Nathaniel Branden]], his wife [[Barbara Branden|Barbara]], and others including [[Alan Greenspan]] and [[Leonard Peikoff]], (jokingly designated &quot;[[The Ayn Rand Collective|The Collective]]&quot;), Rand launched the [[Objectivism|Objectivist]] movement to promote her philosophy.

===The Objectivist movement===
''Main article: The [[Objectivist movement]]''

In 1950 Rand moved to [[New York City]], where in  1951 she met the young [[psychology]] student [[Nathaniel Branden]] [http://www.nathanielbranden.com], who had read her book, ''The Fountainhead'', at the age of 14. Branden, then 19, enjoyed discussing Rand's emerging Objectivist philosophy with her. Together, Branden and some of his other friends formed a group that they dubbed the [[Collective]], which included some participation by future Federal Reserve chairman [[Alan Greenspan]]. After several years, Rand and Branden's friendly relationship blossomed into a romantic affair, despite the fact that both were married at the time. Their spouses were both convinced to accept this affair but it eventually led to the separation and then divorce of [[Nathaniel Branden]] from his wife. Although one of Rand's most strident philosophical points was never to bow to societal pressure or norms, Ayn Rand abandoned her own name (see top of page), as did Branden (born Nathan Blumenthal). 

Throughout the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]], Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through both her fiction [http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_fiction] and non-fiction [http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_nonfiction] works, and by giving talks at several east-coast universities, largely through the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (&quot;the NBI&quot;) which Branden established to promote her philosophy. 

After a convoluted series of separations, Rand abruptly ended her relationship with both Nathaniel Branden and his wife, [[Barbara Branden]], in 1968 when she learned of Nathaniel Branden's affair with Patrecia Scott (this later affair did not overlap chronologically with the earlier Branden/Rand affair).  Rand refused to have any further dealings with the NBI.  She then published a letter in &quot;The Objectivist&quot; announcing her repudiation of Branden for various reasons, including dishonesty, but did not mention their affair or her role in the schism. The two never reconciled, and Branden remained a ''persona non grata'' in the Objectivist movement.

Barbara Branden presented an account of the breakup of the affair in her book, ''The Passion of Ayn Rand.'' She describes the encounter between Nathaniel and Rand, saying that Rand slapped him numerous times, and denounced him in these words: &quot;If you have an ounce of morality left in you, an ounce of psychological health — you'll be impotent for the next twenty years! And if you achieve any potency, you'll know it's a sign of still worse moral degradation!&quot;

Conflicts continued in the wake of the break with Branden and the subsequent collapse of the NBI. Many of her closest &quot;Collective&quot; friends began to part ways, and during the late 70's, her activities within the formal Objectivist movement began to decline, a situation which increased after the death of her husband in 1979. One of her final projects was work on a television adaptation of ''Atlas Shrugged''.

Rand died of heart failure on [[March 6]], [[1982]] in [[New York City]], years after having successfully battled cancer, and was interred in the [[Kensico Cemetery]], [[Valhalla, New York]].

[[Image:Ayn_Rand_Marker.jpg|thumb|right|324px|Grave marker of [[Frank O'Connor (actor)|Frank O'Connor]] and Ayn Rand.]]

===Philosophical influences===
Rand rejected virtually all other philosophical schools. She acknowledged a shared intellectual lineage with [[Aristotle]] and [[John Locke]], and more generally with the philosophies of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[Age of Reason]].  She occasionally remarked with approval on specific philosophical positions of, e.g., [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. She seems also to have respected the American rationalist [[Brand Blanshard]]. However, she regarded most philosophers as at best incompetent and at worst downright evil. She singled out [[Immanuel Kant]] as the most influential of the latter sort.

Nonetheless, there are connections between Rand's views and those of other philosophers. She acknowledged that she had been influenced at an early age by the writings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Though she later repudiated his thought and reprinted her first novel, ''[[We The Living]]'', with some wording changes in 1959, her own thought grew out of critical interaction with it.  Generally, her political thought is in the tradition of [[classical liberalism]]. She expressed qualified enthusiasm for the economic thought of [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Henry Hazlitt]]. Though not mentioned as an influence by her specifically, parallels between her works and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essay [[Self-Reliance]] do exist.  Later Objectivists, such as [[Richard Salsman]], have claimed that Rand's economic theories are implicitly more supportive of the doctrines of [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], though Rand herself was likely not acquainted with his work.

===Politics and House Committee on Un-American Activities testimony===
Rand's political views were radically pro-[[capitalist]], [[anti-statist]], and [[anti-Communist]]. Her writings praised above all the human individual and the creative genius of which one is capable. She exalted what she saw as the heroic [[American values]] of egoism and individualism. Rand also had a strong dislike for [[mysticism]], [[religion]], and compulsory [[charity]], all of which she believed helped foster a crippling culture of resentment towards individual human happiness and success.  Rand detested many prominent [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[conservative]] politicians of her time, even including prominent anti-Communist crusaders like Presidents [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and Senators [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] and [[Joseph McCarthy]] (although she argued that ''[[McCarthyism]]'' was a myth, and that the accusation of McCarthyism was used as an [[ad hominem]] argument to discredit anti-Communists).

In 1947, during the [[Red Scare]], Rand testified as a &quot;friendly witness&quot; before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (see [[http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/texts/huac.html]]). Rand's testimony involved analysis of the 1943 film ''[[Song of Russia]]''. While many believe that Ayn Rand disclosed the names of members of the Communist Party in the U.S., thus exposing them to [[blacklisting]], her testimony consisted entirely of comments regarding the disparity between her experiences in the [[Soviet Union]] and the fanciful portrayal of it in the film.

Rand argued that the movie grossly misrepresented the socioeconomic conditions in the Soviet Union. She told the committee that the film presented life in the USSR as being much better than it actually was. Apparently this 1943 film was intentional wartime [[propaganda]] by U.S. patriots, trying to put their Soviet allies in [[World War II]] under the best possible light. After the HUAC hearings, when Ayn Rand was asked about her feelings on the effectiveness of their investigations, she described the process as &quot;futile&quot;.

==Legacy==
Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including [[Alan Greenspan]]. A six-foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket. [http://www.eckerd.edu/aspec/writers/atlas_shrugged.htm]

In 1985, [[Leonard Peikoff]], a surviving member of &quot;[[The Ayn Rand Collective|The Collective]]&quot; and Ayn Rand's designated heir, established &quot;The [[Ayn Rand Institute]]: The Center for the Advancement of Objectivism&quot; (ARI). The Institute has since registered the name ''Ayn Rand'' as a trademark, despite Rand's desire that her name never be used to promote the philosophy she developed. Rand expressed her wish to keep her name and the philosophy of Objectivism separate to ensure the survival of her ideas. 	 
	 
Another schism in the movement occurred in 1989, when Objectivist [[David Kelley]] wrote &quot;A Question of Sanction,&quot; [http://www.wetheliving.com/boston/sanction.html] in which he defended his choice to speak to non-Objectivist [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] groups. Kelley stated that Objectivism was not a &quot;closed system&quot; and should engage with other philosophies. Peikoff, in an article for ''[[The Intellectual Activist]]'' called &quot;Fact and Value&quot; [http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_f-v], argued that Objectivism is, indeed, a closed system, and that truth and moral goodness are directly related. Peikoff expelled Kelley from his movement, whereupon Kelley founded The Institute for Objectivist Studies (now known as &quot;[[The Objectivist Center]]&quot;).	 

Rand and Objectivism are less well known outside [[North America]], although there are pockets of interest in [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], and her novels are reported to be popular in [[India]] ([http://www.theatlasphere.com/metablog/000058.php]) and to be gaining an increasingly wider audience in [[Africa]]. Her work has had little effect on academic philosophy, for her followers are, with some notable exceptions, drawn from the non-academic world.

[[Neil Peart]], the drummer and lyricist with the Canadian progressive rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]], was influenced by Rand philosophy during the early years of the band. The most notable instances of this are the track &quot;Anthem&quot; from the album ''[[Fly By Night]]'' ([[1975]]) and the title track from the album ''[[2112]]'' ([[1976]]).

==Controversy==
Rand's views are controversial. Religious and socially conservative thinkers have criticized her atheism. Many adherents and practitioners of [[continental philosophy]] criticize her celebration of rationality and self-interest. Within the dominant philosophical movement in the English-speaking world, [[analytic philosophy]], Rand's work has been mostly ignored. No leading research university in this tradition considers Rand or Objectivism to be an important philosophical specialty or research area, as is documented by [[Brian Leiter]]'s report [http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/]. Some academics, however, are trying to bring Rand's work into the mainstream. For instance, the [http://www.aynrandsociety.org/ Ayn Rand Society], founded in 1987, is affiliated with the [[American Philosophical Association]]. In 2006, [[Cambridge University Press]] will publish a volume on Rand's ethical theory written by ARI-affiliated scholar [[Tara Smith]].

A notable exception to the general lack of attention paid to Rand is the essay &quot;On the Randian Argument&quot; by [[Harvard University]] philosopher [[Robert Nozick]], which appears in his collection ''Socratic Puzzles''. Nozick's own [[libertarian]] political conclusions are similar to Rand's, but his essay criticizes her foundational argument in ethics, which claims that one's own life is, for each individual, the only ultimate value because it makes all other values possible. To make this argument sound, Nozick argues that Rand still needs to explain why someone could not rationally prefer the state of eventually dying and having no values. Thus, he argues, her attempt to deduce the morality of selfishness is essentially an instance of assuming the conclusion or [[begging the question]] and that her solution to [[David Hume]]'s famous [[is-ought problem]] is unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, Nozick respected Rand as an author and noted that he found her books enjoyable and thought-provoking.

Rand has sometimes been viewed with suspicion for her practice of presenting her philosophy in fiction and non-fiction books aimed at a general audience rather than publishing in [[peer-review]]ed journals. Rand's defenders note that she is part of a long tradition of authors who wrote philosophically rich fiction — including [[Dante]], [[John Milton]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], and [[Albert Camus]], and that other philosophers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] presented their philosophies in both fictional and non-fictional forms.

Other critics argue that Rand’s idealistic philosophy and her [[Romantic]] literary style are not applicable to the inhabited world. In particular, these critics claim that Rand's novels are made up of unrealistic and one-dimensional characters. They criticize the portrayal of the Objectivist heroes as incredibly intelligent, unencumbered by doubt, wealthy, and free of flaws, in contrast to the frequent portrayal of the antagonists as weak, pathetic, full of uncertainty, and lacking in imagination and talent.

Defenders of Rand point out counterexamples to these criticisms: neither Eddie Willers nor Cherryl Taggart (both positive characters) is especially gifted or intelligent, but both are characters of dignity and respect; Leo Kovalensky suffers enormously due to his inability to cope with the brutality and banality of communism; Andrei Taganov dies after realizing his philosophical errors; Dominique Francon is initially bitterly unhappy because she believes evil is powerful; Hank Rearden is torn by inner emotional conflict brought on by a philosophical contradiction; and Dagny Taggart thinks that she alone is capable of saving the world. Two of her main protagonists, Howard Roark and John Galt, did not begin life wealthy. Though Rand believed that, under capitalism, valuable contributions will routinely be rewarded by wealth, she certainly did not think that wealth made a person virtuous. In fact, she presents many vicious bureaucrats and waspish elitists who use [[statism]] to accumulate money and power. Moreover, Hank Rearden is exploited because of his social naïveté. As for the purportedly weak and pathetic villains, Rand's defenders point out that Ellsworth Toohey is represented as being a great strategist and communicator from an early age, and Dr. Robert Stadler is a brilliant scientist.

Rand herself replied to these literary criticisms (and in advance of much of them) with her essay &quot;The Goal of My Writing&quot; (1963). There, and in other essays collected in her book ''[[The Romantic Manifesto|The Romantic Manifesto: A Philosophy of Literature]]'' (2nd rev. ed. 1975), Rand makes it clear that her goal is to project her vision of an ideal man: not man as he is, but man as he might and ought to be.

Rand's views on sex have also led to some controversy.  According to her, &quot;For a woman ''qua'' woman, the essence of femininity is hero-worship – the desire to look up to man.&quot; (1968)  Some in the [[BDSM]] community see her work as relevant and supportive, particularly  ''The Fountainhead'' [http://www.mistressmorgana.com/site04/read_rec.html].

Another source of controversy is Rand's view that homosexuality is &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot; [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/homo/atlasphere.htm], as well as her support for the right of businesses to discriminate on the basis of homosexuality, such as in their hiring practices.  Specifically, she stated that &quot;there is a psychological immorality at the root of homosexuality&quot; because &quot;it involves psychological flaws, corruptions, errors, or unfortunate premises&quot;.  

On the topic of non-governmental discrimination, Rand's defenders argue that her support for its legality was motivated by holding property rights above civil or human rights (as she did not believe that human rights were distinct from property rights) so it did not constitute an endorsement of the morality of the prejudice itself. In support of this, they cite Rand's opposition to some prejudices &amp;mdash; though not homophobia &amp;mdash; on moral grounds, in essays like 'Racism' and 'Global Balkanization', while still arguing for the right of individuals and businesses to act on such prejudice without government intervention.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alain Connes''' (born [[April 1]], [[1947]]) is a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]], currently Professor at the [[College de France]] ([[Paris]], [[France]]), [[IHES]] ([[Bures-sur-Yvette]], [[France]]) and [[Vanderbilt University]] ([[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]). He is a specialist of [[Von Neumann algebra]]s and succeeded in completing the classification of [[factor]]s of these objects. Although his work in physics was not very convincing he tried to connect the planckian scales with what he called a &quot;2-brane&quot; Universe, model which was largely rejected by string theorists so far.

The remarkable links between this subject, the tools he and others devised to tackle the problem and other subjects in [[theoretical physics]], [[particle physics]], and [[differential geometry]], made him emphasize [[Noncommutative geometry]] (which is also the title of his major book to date).

He was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in [[1982]], the [[Crafoord Prize]] in [[2001]] and the gold medal of the [[CNRS]] in 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Allan Dwan''' ([[April 3]], [[1885 in film|1885]] &amp;ndash; [[December 21]], [[1981 in film|1981]]) was a pioneering [[Canada|Canadian]]-born American [[film|motion picture]] [[film director|director]], producer and screenwriter.

Born '''Joseph Aloysius Dwan''' in [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]], his family moved to the [[United States]] when he was eleven years of age. At university, he trained as an engineer and began working for a lighting company in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. However, he had  a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when [[Essanay Studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in [[California]] where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in [[1911]], Dwan began working part time in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. While still in New York, in [[1917 in film|1917]] he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]].

Allan Dwan became a true innovator in the motion picture industry. After making a series of westerns and comedies,  he directed fellow Canadian, [[Mary Pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed [[1922 in film|1922]] ''[[Robin Hood]]''. 

Following the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], in [[1937 in film|1937]] he directed child-star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi]]'' and ''Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm'' the following year.

Over his long and successful career spanning over fifty years, he directed over 400 motion pictures, many of them highly acclaimed, such as the [[1949 in film|1949]] box office smash, ''[[The Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. His last movie was in [[1961]]. 

Dwan is one of the directors who spanned the silent to sound era. Most of the silent movies he directed are lost due to poor preservation. Little historical writing has been devoted to Dwan, but some believe that he will be the last &quot;discovered&quot; great director from the [[Classic Hollywood Era]].

He died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], [[Mission Hills, California]]. 

Allan Dwan has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]].

{{Economy of Algeria table}}
In the '''economy of Algeria''' the [[hydrocarbons]] sector is the backbone, accounting for roughly 52% of budget revenues, 25% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], and over 95% of export earnings. [[Algeria]] has the fifth-largest reserves of [[natural gas]] in the world and is the second largest gas exporter; it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves. Algiers' efforts to reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world stalled in [[1992]] as the country became embroiled in political turmoil.

Burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year standby arrangement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] in April [[1994]] and the following year signed onto a three-year extended fund facility which ended [[30 April]], [[1998]]. Some progress on economic reform, [[Paris Club]] [[debt rescheduling]]s in [[1995]] and [[1996]], and oil and gas sector expansion contributed to a recovery in growth since 1995, reducing inflation to approximately 1% and narrowing the budget deficit. Algeria's economy has grown at about 4% annually since [[1999]]. The country's foreign debt has fallen from a high of $28 billion in [[1999]] to its current level of $24 billion. The spike in oil prices in [[1999]]-[[2000]] and the government's tight fiscal policy, as well as a large increase in the trade surplus and the near tripling of foreign exchange reserves has helped the country's finances. However, an ongoing drought, the after effects of the [[November 10]], [[2001]] floods and an uncertain oil market make prospects for [[2002]]-[[2003|03]] more problematic. The government pledges to continue its efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector. However, it has thus far had little success in reducing high unemployment, officially estimated at 30% and improving living standards.

[[President Bouteflika]] has announced sweeping economic reforms, which, if implemented, will significantly restructure the economy. Still, the economy remains heavily dependent on volatile oil and gas revenues. The government has continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector, but has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards.  Other priority areas include banking reform, improving the investment environment, and reducing government bureaucracy.

The government has announced plans to sell off state enterprises: sales of a national cement factory and steel plant have been completed and other industries are up for offer. In 2001, Algeria signed an Association Agreement with the [[European Union]]; it has started accession negotiations for entry into the [[World Trade Organization]]. 

===[[Agriculture]]===

Since Roman times Algeria has been noted for the fertility of its soil.  About a quarter of the inhabitants are engaged in agricultural pursuits.  More than 7,500,000 acres (30,000 km&amp;sup2;) are devoted to the cultivation of [[cereal grain]]s.  The Tell is the grain-growing land.  During the time of [[France|French]] rule its productivity was increased substantially by the sinking of [[Artesian aquifer|artesian well]]s in districts which only required water to make them fertile.  Of the crops raised, [[wheat]], [[barley]] and [[oat]]s are the principal cereals.  A great variety of [[vegetable]]s and of [[fruit]]s, especially [[citrus]] products, is exported.  

A considerable amount of [[cotton]] was grown at the time of the [[United States]]' [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but the industry declined afterwards.  In the early years of the 20th century efforts to extend the cultivation of the plant were renewed.  A small amount of [[cotton]] is also grown in the southern oases.  Large quantities of [[crin vegetal]] (vegetable horse-hair) an excellent fibre, are made from the leaves of the dwarf palm.  The [[olive]] (both for its fruit and [[Petroleum]]) and [[tobacco]] are cultivated with great success.

Algeria also exports [[fig]]s, [[date (fruit)|date]]s, [[esparto]] grass, and [[cork (material)|cork]].

====Wine Production====

Throughout Algeria the soil favours the growth of vines.  The country, in the words of an expert sent to report on the subject by the French government, 
:&quot;can produce an infinite variety of wines suitable to every constitution and to every caprice of taste.&quot; 

The growing of vines was undertaken early by the colonists, but it was not until vineyards in [[France]] were attacked by [[phylloxera]] that the export of [[wine]] from Algeria became significant.  In [[1883]], despite precautionary measures, Algerian [[vineyard]]s were also attacked but in the meantime the quality of their wines had been proved.  In 1850 less than 2000 acres (8 km&amp;sup2;) were devoted to the grape, but in 1878 this had increased to over 42,000 acres (170 km&amp;sup2;), which yielded 7,436,000 gallons (28,000 m&amp;sup3;) of wine.  Despite bad seasons and ravages of insects, cultivation extended, and in 1895 the vineyards covered 300,000 acres (1,200 km&amp;sup2;), the produce being 88,000,000 gallons (333,000 m&amp;sup3;).  The area of cultivation in 1905 exceeded 400,000 acres (1,600 km&amp;sup2;), and in that year the amount of wine produced was 157,000,000 gallons (594,000 m&amp;sup3;).  By that time the limits of profitable production had been reached in many parts of the country.  Practically the only foreign market for Algerian wine is France, which in 1905 imported about 110,000,000 gallons (416,000 m&amp;sup3;).

===Fishing===

Fishing is a flourishing but minor industry.  Fish caught are principally [[sardine]]s, [[bonito]], [[smelt]] and [[sprat]]s.  Fresh fish are exported to [[France]], dried and preserved fish to [[Spain]] and [[Italy]].  Coral [[fishery|fisheries]] are found along the coast from [[Bona]] to [[Tunis]].

===Minerals===

Algeria is rich in minerals; the country has many [[iron]], [[lead]] and [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[calamine]], [[antimony]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] mines.  The most productive are those of iron and zinc.  Lignite is found in Algiers; immense [[phosphate]] beds were discovered near [[Tebessa]] in 1891, yielding 313,500 tons in 1905.  Phosphate beds are also worked near [[Setif]], [[Guelma]] and [[Ain Beida]].  There are more than 300 quarries which produce, amongst other stones, [[onyx]] and beautiful white and red [[marble]]s.  Algerian onyx from Ain Tekbalet was used by the Romans, and many ancient quarries have been found near [[Kleber]], some being certainly those from which the long-lost Numidian marbles were taken.  [[Salt]] is collected on the margins of the chotts.

==Foreign trade==

Under French administration the commerce of Algeria developed greatly: the total imports and exports at the time of the French occupation (1830) did not exceed £ 175,000.  In 1850 the figures had reached £ 5,000,000; in 1868, £ 12,000,000; in 1880, £ 17,000,000; and in 1890, £ 20,000,000.  From this point progress was slower and the figures varied considerably year by year.  In 1905 the total value of the foreign trade was £ 24,500,000.  About five-sixths of the trade is with or via France, into which country several Algerian goods have been admitted duty-free since 1851, and all since 1867.  French goods, except [[sugar]], have been admitted into Algeria without payment of duty since 1835.  After the increase, in 1892, of the French minimum tariff, which applied to Algeria also, foreign trade greatly diminished. 

By far Algeria's most significant exports, financially, are [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]].  The reserves are mostly in the Eastern [[Sahara]]; the Algerian government curbed the exports in the 1980s to slow depletion; exports increased again somewhat in the [[1990|1990s]].  Other significant exports are [[domestic sheep|sheep]], [[ox]]en, and [[horse]]s; animal products, such as [[wool]] and skins; [[wine]], cereals ([[rye]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s (chiefly [[fig]]s and [[grape]]s for the table) and [[seed]]s, [[esparto]] grass, oils and vegetable extracts (chiefly [[olive oil]]), [[iron]] ore, [[zinc]], natural [[phosphate]]s, [[timber]], [[Cork (material)|cork]], [[crin vegetal]] and [[tobacco]].  The import of [[wool]] exceeds the export.  [[Sugar]], [[coffee]], machinery, metal work of all kinds, clothing and pottery are largely imported.  Of these by far the greater part comes from France.  The [[United Kingdom|British]] imports consist chiefly of [[coal]], cotton fabrics and machinery.

===Exports===

Algeria trades most extensively with France and [[Italy]], in terms of both imports and exports, but also trades with the United States and [[Spain]].

The '''People's Democratic Republic of Algeria''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''الجمهورية الجزائرية الديمقراطية الشعبية''') , or '''Algeria''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''الجزائر'''), is a presidential state in [[north Africa]], and the second largest country on the [[Africa]]n continent, [[Sudan]] being the largest.  It is bordered by [[Tunisia]] in the northeast, [[Libya]] in the east, [[Niger]] in the southeast, [[Mali]] and [[Mauritania]] in the southwest, and [[Morocco]] as well as a few kilometers of its annexed territory, [[Western Sahara]], in the west. [[Constitution of Algeria|Constitutionally]], it is defined as  an [[Islam]]ic, [[Arab]], and [[Amazigh]] (Berber) country.  The name Algeria is derived from the name of the city of [[Algiers]], from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''al-jazā’ir'', which translates as ''the islands'', referring to the four islands which lay off that city's coast until becoming part of the mainland in 1525.



==History==
{{main|History of Algeria}}

Algeria has been inhabited by [[Berber]]s (or Amazigh) since at least [[10,000 BC]].  From [[1000 BC]] on, the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] became an influence on them, establishing settlements along the coast. Berber kingdoms began to emerge, most notably [[Numidia]], and seized the opportunity offered by the Punic Wars to become independent of Carthage, only to be taken over soon after by the [[Roman Republic]] in 200 BC.  As the western [[Roman Empire]] collapsed, the Berbers became independent again in much of the area, while the [[Vandals]] took over parts until later expelled by the generals of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], [[Justinian I]].  The [[Byzantine Empire]] then retained a precarious grip on the east of the country until the coming of the [[Arab]]s in the [[8th century]].

[[Image:Roman Arch of Trajan at Thamugadi (Timgad), Algeria 04966r.jpg|thumb|left|Roman arch of Trajan at Thamugadi (Timgad), Algeria]]
After some decades of fierce resistance under leaders such as [[Kusayla]] and [[Kahina]], the Berbers adopted [[Islam]] ''en masse'', but almost immediately expelled the [[Caliphate]] from Algeria, establishing an [[Ibadi]] state under the [[Rustamid]]s.  Having converted the [[Kutama]] of [[Kabylie]] to its cause, the [[Shia]] [[Fatimid]]s overthrew the Rustamids, and conquered Egypt.  They left Algeria and Tunisia to their [[Zirid]] vassals; when the latter rebelled and adopted [[Sunni]]sm, they sent in a populous [[Arab]] tribe, the [[Banu Hilal]], to weaken them, thus incidentally initiating the [[Arabization]] of the countryside.  The [[Almoravid]]s and [[Almohad]]s, Berber dynasties from the west founded by religious reformers, brought a period of relative peace and development; however, with the Almohads' collapse, Algeria became a battleground for their three [[successor state]]s, the Algerian [[Zayyanid]]s, Tunisian [[Hafsid]]s, and Moroccan [[Merinid]]s.  In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, [[Spain]] started attacking and taking over many coastal cities, prompting some to seek help from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Algeria was brought into the Ottoman Empire by [[Khair ad Din|Khair ad-Din]] and his  brother [[Aruj]], who established Algeria's modern boundaries in the north and made its coast a base for the [[Privateer|corsairs]]; their privateering peaked in Algiers in the 1600s. Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]] with the [[United States]]. On the pretext of a slight to their consul, the [[France|French]] invaded Algiers in 1830; however, intense resistance from such personalities as [[Emir Abdelkader]], [[Ahmed Bey]] and [[Lalla Fatma N'Soumer|Fatma N'Soumer]] made for a slow conquest of Algeria, not technically completed until the early 1900s when the last [[Tuareg]] were conquered.
[[Image:Constantine Algerien 002.jpg|thumb|left|Constantine, Algeria 1840]]

Meanwhile, however, the French suppressed slavery and made Algeria an integral part of France, a status that would end only with the collapse of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. Tens of thousands of settlers from France, Italy, Spain, and Malta moved in to farm the Algerian coastal plain and occupy the most prized parts of Algeria's cities, benefiting from the French government's confiscation of communally held land. People of European descent in Algeria (the so-called ''[[pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]''), as well as the native Algerian Jews, were full French citizens starting from the end of the 19th century; by contrast, the vast majority of Muslim Algerians (even veterans of the French army) remained outside of French law, possessing neither French citizenship nor the right to vote. Algeria's social fabric was stretched to breaking point during this period: literacy dropped massively, while land confiscation uprooted much of the population.

In 1954, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) launched the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[Algerian War of Independence]]; after nearly a decade of urban and rural warfare, they succeeded in pushing France out in 1962. Most of the 1,025,000 ''[[pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]'', as well as 91,000 ''[[harki]]s'' (pro-French Muslim Algerians serving in the French Army), together forming about 10% of the population of Algeria in 1962, fled Algeria for France in just a few months in the middle of that year.

[[Image:TheBattleofAlgiers.png|thumb|right|''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'' is a movie about the [[Algerian War of Independence]].]]
Algeria's first president, the FLN leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], was overthrown by his former ally and defense minister, [[Houari Boumédiènne]] in 1965. Under Ben Bella the government had already become increasingly socialist and dictatorial, and this trend continued throughout Boumedienne's government; however, Boumedienne relied much more heavily on the army, and reduced the sole legal party to a merely symbolic role.  Agriculture was collectivised, and a massive industrialization drive launched.  Oil extraction facilities were nationalized and this increased the state's wealth, especially after the 1973 oil crisis, but the Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, bringing hardship when the price collapsed in the 1980s.  In foreign policy Algeria was a member and leader of the 'non-aligned' nations.  A dispute with Morocco over the [[Western Sahara]] nearly led to war.  Dissent was rarely tolerated, and the state's control over the media and the outlawing of political parties other than the FLN was cemented in the repressive constitution of 1976.  Boumédienne died in 1978, but the rule of his successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], was little more open.  The state took on a strongly bureaucratic character and corruption was widespread.

The modernization drive brought considerable demographic changes to Algeria.  Village traditions underwent significant change as urbanization increased, new industries emerged, agriculture was substantially reduced, and education, a rarity in colonial times, was extended nationwide, raising the literacy rate from less than 10% to over 60%.  Improvements in healthcare led to a dramatic increase in the birthrate (7-8 children per mother) which had two consequences: a very youthful population, and a housing crisis.  The new generation struggled to relate to the cultural obsession with the war years and two conflicting protest movements developed: left-wingers, including Berber identity movements, and Islamic 'intégristes'.  Both protested against one-party rule but also clashed with each other in universities and on the streets during the 1980s.  Mass protests from both camps in autumn 1988 forced Benjedid to concede the end of one-party rule, and elections were announced for 1991.

In December 1991, the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] won the [[Algerian National Assembly elections, 1991|first round]] of the country's first multiparty elections. The military then canceled the second round, forced then-president Bendjedid to resign, and banned the Islamic Salvation Front. The ensuing conflict engulfed Algeria in the violent [[Algerian Civil War]].  More than 100,000 people were killed, often in unprovoked massacres of civilians.  The question of who was responsible for these massacres remains controversial among academic observers; many were claimed by the [[Armed Islamic Group]].  After 1998, the war waned, and by 2002 the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or surrendered, taking advantage of an amnesty program, though sporadic fighting continued in some areas.  Elections resumed in 1995, and in 1999, after a series of short-term leaders representing the military, [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], the current president, was elected. The issue of Berber language and identity increased in significance, particularly after the extensive [[Kabyle]] protests of 2001 and the near-total boycott of local elections in [[Kabylie]]; the government responded with concessions including naming of [[Tamazight]] (Berber) as a national language and teaching it in schools.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Algeria}}

The head of state is the [[President of Algeria|President of the republic]], who is elected to a 5-year term, renewable once. Algeria has [[universal suffrage]]. The President is the head of the Council of Ministers and of the High Security Council. He appoints the [[Prime Minister of Algeria|Prime Minister]] who is also the head of government. The Prime Minister appoints the Council of Ministers.

The Algerian [[parliament]] is bicameral, consisting of a lower chamber, the National People's Assembly (APN), with 380 members and an upper chamber, the Council of Nation, with 144 members. The APN is elected every 5 years.

Throughout the 1960's, Algeria supported many independence movements in sub-Saharan Africa, and was a leader in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. While it shares much of its history and cultural heritage with neighbouring [[Morocco]], the two countries have had somewhat hostile relations with each other since Algeria's independence. This is due to two reasons: Morocco's [[Greater Morocco|claim to portions of western Algeria]] (which led to the [[Sand war]] in 1963), and Algeria's support for the [[Polisario]], an armed group of [[Sahrawi]] [[refugee]]s seeking [[independence]] for the Moroccan-ruled [[Western Sahara]], which it hosts within its borders in the city of [[Tindouf]]. Tensions between Algeria and Morocco, as well as issues relating to the [[Algerian Civil War]], have put great obstacles in the way of tightening the [[Maghreb Arab Union]], nominally established in 1989 but with little practical weight, with its coastal neighbors.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Algeria}}

[[Image:Algeria map.png|220px|right|Map of Algeria with cities]]
[[Image:Hoggar3.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ahaggar Mountains|Hoggar]] Mountains]]

Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are few good harbours. The area just south of the coast, known as the [[Tell]], is fertile. Further south is the [[Atlas mountains|Atlas mountain]] range and the [[Sahara]] desert. [[Algiers]], [[Oran]] and [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] are the main cities.

Algeria's [[climate]] is arid and hot, although the coastal climate is mild, and the winters in the mountainous areas can be severe. Algeria is prone to [[sirocco]], a hot dust- and sand-laden wind especially common in summer.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Algeria}}

[[Image:Unknown origin coin2.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Algerian coins]]
The fossil fuels energy sector is the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the fifth-largest reserves of [[natural gas]] in the world and is the second largest gas exporter; it ranks 14th in [[Petroleum]] reserves.

Algeria’s financial and economic indicators improved during the mid-1990s, in part because of policy reforms supported by the IMF and debt rescheduling from the [[Paris Club]]. Algeria’s finances in 2000 and 2001 benefited from an increase in oil prices and the government’s tight fiscal policy, leading to a large increase in the trade surplus, record highs in foreign exchange reserves, and reduction in foreign debt. The government's continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards. In 2001, the government signed an Association Treaty with the [[European Union]] that will eventually lower tariffs and increase trade.

==Demographics==
[[Image:Algiers coast.jpg|thumb|[[Algiers]] coast]]
{{main|Demographics of Algeria}}

About 90% of Algerians live in the northern, coastal area; the minority who inhabit the [[Sahara desert]] are mainly concentrated in [[oasis|oases]], although some 1.5 million remain [[nomad]]ic or partly nomadic.

Ninety-nine percent of the population is classified ethnically as [[Arab]]/[[Berber]], and religiously as [[Muslim]]; other religions are restricted to extremely small groups, mainly of foreigners. Europeans account for less than 1%.

Most Algerians are Arab by language and identity, and of mixed Berber-Arab ancestry. The Berbers inhabited Algeria before the arrival of Arab tribes during the expansion of Islam, in the 7th century. The issue of ethnicity and language is sensitive after many years of government marginalization of Berber (or [[Amazigh]], as some prefer) culture. Today, the Arab-Berber issue is often a case of self-identification or identification through language and culture, rather than a racial or ethnic distinction. The 20% or so of the population who self-identify as Berbers, and primarily speak Berber languages (such as [[Tamazight]]), are divided into several ethnic groups, notably [[Kabyle]] (the largest) in the mountainous north-central area, [[Chaoui]] in the eastern [[Atlas Mountains]], [[Mozabite]]s in the [[M'zab]] valley, and [[Tuareg]] in the far south.

==Language==
{{main|Languages of Algeria}}

The [[official language]] is [[Arabic language|Arabic]], spoken natively in dialectal form (&quot;[[Algerian Arabic|Darja]]&quot;) by some 80% of the population; the other 20% or so speak [[Berber]] ([[Tamazight]]), officially a [[national language]]. [[French language|French]] is the most widely studied foreign language (distantly followed by [[English language|English]]), but is very rare as a [[native language]]. Since independence, the government has pursued a policy of linguistic [[Arabization]] of education and bureaucracy, with some success, although many university courses continue to be taught in French.

==Culture==
[[Image:Algiers mosque.jpg|thumb|[[Mosque]] in Algiers]]
{{main|Culture of Algeria}}

Modern Algerian literature, split between Arabic and French, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history.  [[List of Algerian writers|Famous novelists]] of the 20th century include [[Mohammed Dib]] and [[Kateb Yacine]], while [[Assia Djebar]] is widely translated.  Important novelists of the 1980s included [[Rachid Mimouni]], later vice-president of Amnesty International, and [[Tahar Djaout]], murdered by an [[Islamist]] group in 1993 for his secularist views.  As early as Roman times, [[Apuleius]], born in [[Mdaourouch]], was native to what would become Algeria.

In philosophy and the humanities, [[Malek Bennabi]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] are noted for their thoughts on [[decolonization]], while [[Augustine of Hippo]] was born in [[Tagaste]] (about 60 miles from the present day city of [[Annaba]]), and [[Ibn Khaldun]], though born in [[Tunis]], wrote the [[Muqaddima]] while staying in Algeria.

Algerian culture has been strongly influenced by [[Islam in Algeria|Islam]], the main religion.  The works of the [[Sanusi]] family in precolonial times, and of Emir [[Abdelkader]] and Sheikh [[Ben Badis]] in colonial times, are widely noted.

The [[Music of Algeria|Algerian musical]] genre best known abroad is [[raï]], a pop-flavored, opinionated take on folk music, featuring international stars such as [[Khaled (musician)|Khaled]] and [[Cheb Mami]].  However, in Algeria itself the older, highly verbal [[chaabi]] style remains more popular, with such stars as [[El Hadj El Anka]] or [[Dahmane El Harrachi]], while the tuneful melodies of [[Kabyle]] music, exemplified by [[Idir]], [[Ait Menguellet]], or [[Lounès Matoub]], have a wide audience.  For more classical tastes, [[Andalusian classical music|Andalusi music]], brought from [[Al-Andalus]] by [[Morisco]] refugees, is preserved in many older coastal towns.

In painting, [[Mohammed Khadda]] and [[M'hemed Issiakhem]] are notable in recent years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Characters in [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel, [[Atlas Shrugged]].'''

{{spoiler}}

==Balph Eubank==
Called &quot;the literary leader of the age&quot;, despite the fact that he is incapable of writing anything that people actually want to read. What people ''want'' to read, he says, is irrelevant. He complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to ten thousand copies. He is a member of the ''Looters''. Balph Eubank appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
==Ben Nealy==
A railroad contractor whom ''Dagny Taggart'' hires to replace the track on the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Rio Norte Line|Rio Norte Line]] with [[Technology in Atlas Shrugged#Rearden Metal|Rearden Metal]]. Nealy is incompetent, but Dagny can find no one better in all the country. Nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power. He sees no role for intelligence in human achievement, and this is manifest in his inability to organize the project and to make decisions. He relies on Dagny and ''Ellis Wyatt'' to run things, and resents them for doing it, because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around. Ben Nealy appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==Bertram Scudder==
Editorial writer for the magazine ''The Future''. He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation. He wrote a hatchet job on ''Hank Rearden'' called ''The Octopus''. He is also vocal in support of the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Equalization of Opportunity Bill|Equalization of Opportunity Bill]]. Bertram Scudder appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==Betty Pope==
A wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual affair with ''James Taggart'' that coincides with the overall meaninglessness of her life. She regrets having to wake up every morning because she has to face another empty day. She is deliberately crude in a way that casts ridicule on her high social position. Betty Pope appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 142 and 161.
==Brakeman==
An unnamed employee working on the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Taggart Comet|Taggart Comet]] train. ''Dagny Taggart'' hears Brakeman whistling the theme of a concerto. When she asks him what piece it is from, he says it is [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Halley's Fifth Concerto|Halley's Fifth Concerto]]. When Dagny points out that ''Richard Halley'' only wrote four concertos, Brakeman claims he made a mistake and he doesn't recall where he heard the piece.

Later, after Dagny instructs the train crew how to proceed, he asks a co-worker who she is, and learns she is the one who runs [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental]].

It is later discovered that the unknown brakeman is one of the strikers, when Dagny meets him in the valley. Brakeman appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112 and 113.

==Cherryl Brooks==
Dime store shopgirl who marries James Taggart after a chance encounter in her store the night the John Galt Line was deemed his greatest success.  She marries him thinking he is the heroic person behind Taggart Transcontinental. She is horrible to Dagny until the night before she commits suicide, when she confesses to Dagny that she married Jim, thinking she was marrying Dagny. Like Eddie Willers, Cherryl is one representation of a &quot;good&quot; person who lacks the extraordinary capacities of the primary heroes of the novel.

==Claude Slagenhop==
The president of political organization [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Friends of Global Progress]] (which is supported by ''Philip Rearden''), and one of ''Lillian Rearden's'' friends. He believes that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for action. He is not bothered by the fact that action unguided by ideas is random and pointless. Global Progress is a sponsor of the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Equalization of Opportunity Bill]]. Claude Slagenhop appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
==Cuffy Meigs==
A looter who's assigned by Wesley Mouch to keep watch over the workings of ''Taggart Transcontinental,'' and later assumes control over the company after Dagny Taggart leaves. He carries a pistol and a lucky rabbit's foot, he dresses in a military uniform. The &quot;intellectual heir&quot; of Dr. Robert Stadler, Meigs comes to a fitting end at the hands of ''Project X.''

==Dagny Taggart==
The main character in Atlas Shrugged (also the name of her namesake ''Mrs. Nathaniel Taggart''). Dagny is Vice-President in Charge of Operation at Taggart Transcontinental.  She is the female hero, the counterpart to John Galt, her journey is the journey of the reader exploring and understanding Galts philosophy. Those in the know understand that she is the one who really runs the railroad. In the course of the novel, she forms romantic liaisons with three men of ability. Francisco, Hank Rearden and John Galt in order. John is the one who, because of the sum-total of his qualities, will become the choice of Dagny. Dagny appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112, 113, 114, 132, 133, 141, 145, 146, 147, 148, 151, 152, and 161.

==Dan Conway==
The middle-aged president of the [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Phoenix-Durango]] railroad. Running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows. When the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule]] is used to drive his business out of [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Colorado]], he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing. He claims that somebody had to be sacrificed, it turned out to be him, and he has no right to complain, bowing to the will of the majority. When pressed he says he doesn't really believe this is right, but he can't understand why it is wrong and what the alternative might be. He is trapped by a moral code that makes him a willing victim, and rather than challenge that morality, he simply gives up. Dan Conway appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 145 and 146, and is mentioned in section 148.
==Dick McNamara==
A contractor who finished the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|San Sebastian Line]] and who is hired to lay the new [[Technology in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Metal]] track for the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]]. Before he gets a chance to do so, he mysteriously disappears. Dick McNamara is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 133 and 141.
==Eddie Willers==
Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operation at Taggart Transcontinental. He grew up with ''Dagny Taggart''. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and he followed in their footsteps. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]]. He is also secretly in love with Dagny. Willers is generally assumed to represent the common man: someone who does not possess the promethian creative ability of The Strikers, but nevertheless matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. Eddie Willers appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 117, 132, 133, 141, 151, and 152.

==Ellis Wyatt==
The head of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Wyatt Oil]]. He has almost single-handedly revived the economy of [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Colorado]] by discovering oil there. Of all the disappearances of industrialists in the novel, Wyatt's, involving the fiery destruction of his oil wells, is surely the most dramatic. Ellis Wyatt is mentioned or appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 132, 146, 147, 148, and 152.

==Francisco d'Anconia==
One of the central characters in [[Atlas Shrugged]]. By all accounts, he is a worthless millionaire playboy, owner by inheritance of the world's largest copper mining empire, the man behind the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|San Sebastian Mines]], and a childhood friend and first love of ''Dagny Taggart''.

Francisco began working on the sly as a teenager in order to learn all he could about business. While still a student at [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Patrick Henry University]], he began working at a copper foundry, and investing in the stock market. By the time he was twenty he had made enough to purchase the foundry. He began working for [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|d'Anconia Copper]] as assistant superintendent of a mine in Montana, but was quickly promoted to head of the New York office. He took over d'Anconia Copper at age 23, after the death of his father.

When he was 26, Francisco secretly joined the ''Strikers'' and began to slowly destroy the d'Anconia empire so the ''Looters'' could not get it. He adopted the persona of a worthless playboy, by which he is known to the world, as an effective cover.

His full name is Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian d'Anconia.

''According to [mailto:areed2@calstatela.edu Adam Reed] ([http://www.monmouth.com/~adamreed/Ayn_Rands_jewish_years/Who_is_Francisco_DAnconia.html Who is Francisco D'Anconia?]), d'Anconia is the only Hero-class character who is recognizably Jewish (not in the religious, but in the historical sense, like Ayn Rand herself).'' Francisco D'Anconia appears or is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 132, 141, 144, 151, and 152 - this last section includes a detailed history of his life.
==Hank Rearden==
One of the central characters in [[Atlas Shrugged]]. He is the founder of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Steel]] and the inventor of [[Technology in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Metal]]. He lives in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Philadelphia]] with his wife ''Lillian'', his brother ''Philip'', and an elderly woman known only as ''Rearden's Mother'', all of whom he supports. [[Gwen Ives]] is his secretary.

The character of Hank Rearden has two important roles to play in the novel. First, he is in the same position as the reader in that he is aware that there is something wrong with the world but is not sure what it is. Rearden is guided toward an understanding of the solution through his friendship with ''Francisco d'Anconia'', who does know the secret, and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in [[Atlas Shrugged/Galts Speech|Galt's Speech]]. 

Second, Rearden is used to illustrate Rand's [[Concepts in Atlas Shrugged|theory of sex]]. ''Lillian Rearden'' cannot appreciate Hank Rearden's virtues, and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex. ''Dagny Taggart'' clearly does appreciate Rearden's virtues, and this appreciation evolves into a sexual desire. Rearden is torn by a contradiction because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct, while responding sexually to Dagny, who represents his highest values. Rearden struggles to resolve this internal conflict and in doing so illustrates Rand's sexual theory. Rearden appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121, 132, 147, and 161, and is mentioned in sections 114 and 131.

==Hugh Akston==
Identified as &quot;One of the last great advocates of reason.&quot; He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Patrick Henry University]], where he taught ''Francisco d'Anconia'', ''John Galt'', and ''Ragnar Danneskjöld''. He was, along with ''Robert Stadler'', a father figure to these three. Akston's name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. Hugh Akston is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
==James Taggart==
The President of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]] and a leader of the ''Looters''. Taggart is an expert influence peddler who is incapable of making decisions on his own. He relies on his sister ''Dagny Taggart'' to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny.

As the novel progresses, the moral philosophy of the Looters is revealed: it is a code of [[nihilism]]. The goal of this code is to not exist, to become a zero. Taggart struggles to remain unaware that this is his goal. He maintains his pretence that he wants to live, and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about himself. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to destroy those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. James Taggart appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 131, 132, 143, 144, 152 and 161, and is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 146 and 148.

==John Galt==
*The question &quot;[[Who is John Galt?]]&quot; is asked repeatedly throughout [[Atlas Shrugged]]. Late into the book we learn that '''John Galt''' is the man who stopped the motor of the world and the leader of the ''Strikers''. He is also the same character as the '''Mystery Worker'''.

The son of an [[Ohio]] garage mechanic, Galt left home at age 12 and began college at [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]] at age 16. There he befriended [[#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]] and [[#Ragnar Danneskjöld|Ragnar Danneskjöld]], all three of whom double-majored in [[physics]] and [[philosophy]]. They were the cherished students of the brilliant scientist [[#Robert Stadler|Robert Stadler]] and the brilliant philosopher [[#Hugh Akston|Hugh Akston]].

After graduating, Galt became an [[engineer]] at the [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Twentieth Century Motor Works]] where he designed a revolutionary new motor powered by ambient static electricity with the potential to change the world. Like [[#Ellis Wyatt|Ellis Wyatt]], he has created what many had for years said was impossible. When the company owners decided to run the factory by the collectivist maxim, 'By each according to his ability, to each according to his need', Galt organized a successful [[labor strike]], proclaiming his promise to stop the motor of the world.  He began traversing the globe, meeting the world's most successful businessmen, systematically convincing them to follow in his footsteps; one by one, they began abandoning their business empires (which, Galt convinced them, were doomed to failure anyhow, given the increased nationalization of industry by the government).

Secretly, these captains of industry, led by Galt and [[banker]] [[#Midas Mulligan|Midas Mulligan]], had created their own society &amp;mdash; a secret enclave of rational individualists living in &quot;[[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Galt's Gulch|Galt's Gulch]]&quot;, a town secluded high in a wilderness of mountains.  [[#Dagny Taggert|Dagny]] accidentally finds the town &amp;mdash; and a shocked John Galt &amp;mdash; by crash-landing a light [[aircraft]] while pursuing [[#Quentin Daniels|Quentin Daniels]].

Since everyone across the country is repeating the phrase, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;, it is natural that many people have attempted to answer that question. The phrase becomes an expression of helplessness and despair at the current state of the world. ''Dagny Taggart'' hears a number of [[Things in Atlas Shrugged#John Galt Legends|John Galt Legends]] before finding the real John Galt and eventually joining his cause, and learning that all of the stories have an element of truth to them.

:''There is a clothing store in [[Vail, Colorado]] called John Galt Ltd. One presumes that, on occasion, a customer unknowingly walks in and asks, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;''

==Lillian Rearden==
The wildly unsupportive wife of ''Hank Rearden''. They have been married eight years as the novel begins.

Lillian is a frigid ''Moocher'' who seeks to destroy her husband. She compares being Rearden's wife with owning the world's most powerful horse. Since she cannot comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast, she must bridle it down to her level, even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be greviously wasted.

Lillian also serves to illustrate Rand's [[Concepts in Atlas Shrugged|Theory of sex]]. She believes sex is a base animal instinct and that sexual indulgence is a sign of moral weakness. She is incapable of feeling this kind of desire, which she believes testifies to her moral superiority. However, according to the theory of sex Lillian's lack of sexual capacity results from her inability to experience value in herself; she is therefore unable to respond sexually when she experiences value in others.

Lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is 'realistic' enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161 she indicates that she abhors ''Francisco d'Anconia'', because she believes he is a sexual adventurer. Lillian Rearden appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121 and 161.

==The Looters==
A group of evil characters sometimes referred to as &quot;James Taggart and his friends&quot;. They are similar to the Moochers. The Looters consist of men and women who use force to obtain value from those who produce it. They seek to destroy the producers despite the fact that they are dependent upon them. The Looters include: Mr. Thompson, Balph Eubank, Floyd Ferris, James Taggart, Orren Boyle, Paul Larkin, Robert Stadler, Simon Pritchett, Wesley Mouch, and Cuffy Miegs. 
==Midas Mulligan==
A wealthy banker who mysteriously disappears in protest after he is given a court order to loan money to an incompetent loan applicant. Midas Mulligan is responsible for the creation and distribution of the money that is exclusively used in Galt's Gulch, and is the original owner of the land where Galt's Gulch is located. He is also responsible for the production of the money used there.
==The Moochers==
A group of characters, similar to the ''Looters'', who use guilt as a weapon against those who produce value. They seek to destroy the producers despite the fact that they are dependent upon them. The Moochers include ''Lillian Rearden'', ''Philip Rearden'', and Hank Rearden's ''mother''.

==Mort Liddy==
A [[hack writer|hack]] composer who writes trite scores for movies and modern symphonies that no one listens to. He believes melody is a primitive vulgarity. He is one of ''Lillian Rearden's'' friends and a member of the cultural elite. Mort Liddy appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==Mr. Mowen==
The president of the [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, Inc.]] of Connecticut. He is a businessman who sees nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other than the good of society. He is unable to grapple with abstract issues, and is frightened of anything controversial. Dagny Taggart hires Mr. Mowen to produce switches made of [[Technology in Atlas Shrugged|Rearden Metal]]. He is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be ridden and cajoled before he is willing to accept the contract.  When pressured by public opinion, he discontinues production of the switches, forcing Dagny to find an alternative source. Mr. Mowen appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==Mystery Worker==
A menial worker for [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]] who often dines with ''Eddie Willers'' in the employee's cafeteria. Eddie finds him very easy to talk to, and Mystery Worker not-so-subtly leads him on so that Eddie reveals important information about ''Dagny Taggart'' and Taggart Transcontinental. Eddie tells him which suppliers and contractors Dagny is most dependent on, and with remarkable consistency, those are the next men to disappear mysteriously. Mystery Worker is actually John Galt. Mystery Worker appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 133.

==The unnamed newsstand owner==
He works in the Taggart Terminal. Twenty years ago he owned a cigarette factory but it went under, and he's been working at his newsstand ever since. He is a collector of cigarettes, and knows every brand ever made. He occasionally chats with ''Dagny Taggart'' when she comes by. On one occasion, in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 132, after Dagny asks him about his collection, he bemoans the fact that there are no new brands and the old brands are all disappearing. He examines a cigarette given to Dagny by ''Hugh Akston'', but it is a new brand that he has never seen before. It carries the sign of the dollar. In his first appearance, the Newsstand Owner likens the fire of a cigarette to the fire of the mind. This alludes to the Greek myth of Prometheus, who gave mankind the gift of fire, allowing it to raise itself up and become civilized. In [[Atlas Shrugged]], it is the mind of man that raises mankind. Thus the cigarettes become symbolic of the men of the mind. The disappearance of the old brands represents the disappearance of the men of the mind, and the Newsstand Owner's discovery of the new brand foreshadows Dagny's discovery of a new kind of men of the mind.

==Orren Boyle==
The head of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Associated Steel]] and a friend of ''James Taggart''. He is one of the ''Looters''. He is an investor in the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|San Sebastian Mines]]. Orren Boyle appears or is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 131, 132, 144, and 152.
==Owen Kellogg==
Assistant to the Manager of the Taggart Terminal in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|New York]]. He catches ''Dagny Taggart's'' eye as one of the few competent men on staff. After seeing the sorry state of the Ohio Division she decides to make him to its new Superintendent. However, as soon as she returns to [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|New York]], Kellogg informs her that he is quitting his job. He admits that he loves his work, but that's not enough to keep him. He won't say why he is leaving or what he will do. Later, he is noticed working as transient labor by the unsuccessful/unmotivated businessman ''Mr. Mowen''. Owen Kellog eventually reaches, and settles in Atlantis. Owen Kellogg appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112 and 114.

==Paul Larkin==
An unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the Rearden family, and a member of the ''Looters''. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121 Larkin visits [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Philadelphia]] to warn ''Hank Rearden'' of possible trouble from [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Washington]]. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 131 he meets with the other Looters to work out a plan to bring Rearden down. James Taggart knows he is friends with Hank Rearden and challenges his loyalty, and Larkin assures Taggart that he will go along with them. Paul Larkin appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121, 132, and 2A1.
==Philip Rearden==
The younger brother of ''Hank Rearden'', and a ''Moocher''. He lives in his brother's home in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Philadelphia]] and is completely dependent on him. He believes that the source of his sustenance is evil and would love to see him destroyed. He has never had a career and spends his time perfunctorily working for various social groups.
He becomes resentful of his brother's charity. He then requests that he be granted a job from his brother because he should not have to be burdened by the feeling of inadequacy of not earning his own livelihood. When confronted by his brother on how this job should be a mutually beneficial arrangement, Philip shrugs the argument off as irrelevant and that the job should be entitled to him solely based on his need for money and the fact of familial ties. Philip Rearden appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121 and 161.

==Quentin Daniels==
An enterprising engineer hired by ''Dagny Taggart'' to reconstruct ''John Galt's'' motor.  Partway through this process, Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself had.  Dagny sets out to meet Quentin in hopes of convincing him to resume his work.  John Galt narrowly gets to him first.  Dagny's pursuit of Quentin leads her to &quot;[[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Galt's Gulch|Galt's Gulch]]&quot;

==Ragnar Danneskjöld==
One of the original ''Strikers''. He is now world famous as a pirate. Ragnar was from [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Norway]], the son of a bishop and the scion of one of Norway's most ancient, noble families. He attended [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Patrick Henry University]] and became friends with ''John Galt'' and ''Francisco d'Anconia'', while studying under ''Hugh Akston'' and ''Robert Stadler''.

Ragnar seizes relief ships that are being sent from the [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|United States]] to [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Europe]]. No one knows what he does with the goods he seizes. As the novel progresses, Ragnar begins, for the first time, to become active in American waters, and is even spotted in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Delaware Bay]]. Reportedly, his ship is better than any available in the fleets of the world's navies. 

When he became a pirate, he was disowned and excommunicated. There is a price on his head in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Norway]], [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Portugal]], [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Turkey]]. 

According to Ayn Rand (verbal report), his name is a tribute to Victor Hugo.  In Hugo's first novel, ''Hans of Iceland'', the hero becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskjöld.  His name may be a pun on 'Dane's Gold', although &quot;skjöld&quot; means shield, not gold. Ragnar Danneskjöld appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==Rearden's mother==
Named Gertrude, she is a ''Moocher'' who lives with her son ''Hank Rearden'' at his home in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Philadelphia]]. She is involved in church-based charity work, and berates Rearden whenever she can. She insults him by saying he was always selfish, even as a child. She dotes on her weak son ''Philip Rearden''. Rearden's mother appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121.

==Richard Halley==
Dagny Taggart's favorite composer, who mysteriously disappeared after the evening of his greatest triumph. In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141 we learn that Richard Halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer. At age 24 his opera ''Phaethon'' was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it. (It was based on the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] in which [[Phaethon]] steals his father's chariot, and dies in an audacious attempt to drive the sun across the sky. Halley changed the story, though, into one of triumph, in which Phaethon succeeds.) For years Halley wrote in obscurity. After nineteen years, ''Phaethon'' was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard. It appears his critics felt he had paid his dues long enough that he was at last worthy of their approval. The following day, Halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared. Richard Halley is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112, 114, 133, and 141, and appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152.
==Dr. Robert Stadler==
A former professor at Patrick Henry University, mentor to ''Francisco d'Anconia'', ''John Galt'' and ''Ragnar Danneskjöld''. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: ''Project X.''
==Dr. Simon Pritchett==
The prestigious head of the Department of Philosophy at [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Patrick Henry University]] and is considered the leading philosopher of the age. He is also a ''Looter''. He is certainly representative of the philosophy of the age - he is a crude reductionist who believes man is nothing but a collection of chemicals; he believes there are no standards, that definitions are fluid, reason is a superstition, that it is futile to seek meaning in life, and that the duty of a philosopher is to show that nothing can be understood. He explains all this in his book ''The Metaphysical Contradictions of the Universe'', and at cocktail parties. Dr. Pritchett appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.
==The Strikers==
People of the mind who go on strike because they do not appreciate being exploited by ''the Looters'' and demonized by a society who depends on them for its very existence. The leader of the Strikers is ''John Galt''. Other Strikers include: Hugh Akston, Francisco d'Anconia, Ragnar Danneskjöld, Richard Halley, and the Brakeman. Characters who join the Strikers in the course of the book include: Dagny Taggart, Ellis Wyatt, Hank Rearden, Dick McNamara, and Owen Kellogg.
==Mr. Thompson==
The &quot;[[Head of State|Head of the State]],&quot; which essentially means that he's the [[President of the United States]], though he's never specifically referred to as such. In the world of ''Atlas Shrugged'' all Presidents and Prime Ministers are referred to simply as &quot;Head of the State&quot; and &quot;Mr. ____.&quot; This is because countries have been standardized as &quot;People's States&quot; which seem to share a common form of government. Thomspon's title can thus be seen as reflecting the fact that the US is in the process of evolving into one of these &quot;People's States.&quot; One of the Looters, he's not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. Rand's notes indicate that she modelled him on President [[Harry S. Truman]].

==Wesley Mouch==
A member of the ''Looters'' and, at the beginning of the storyline, the incompetent lobbyist whom ''Hank Rearden'' reluctantly employs in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Washington]]. Initially Wesley Mouch is the least powerful and least significant of the Looters - the other members of this group feel they can look down upon him with impunity. Eventually he becomes the most powerful Looter, and the [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|country's]] economic dictator, thereby illustrating Rand's belief that a government-run economy places too much power in the hands of incompetent bureaucrats who would never have positions of similar influence in a private sector business. Wesley Mouch appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 131 and is mentioned in section 161.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Technology in Atlas Shrugged''', [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel includes a variety of technological products and devices.  In addition to real world technology ([[aircraft]], [[automobile]]s, [[diesel engine]]s, [[phonograph record]]s, [[radio]]s, [[telephone]]s, [[television]], and [[traffic signals]]) [[Atlas Shrugged]] also includes various fictional technologies or fictional variants on real inventions.

{{spoilers}}

==Fictional technology==
Fictional inventions mentioned in the book include refractor rays (Gulch mirage), Rearden Metal, a sonic [[death ray]] (&quot;Project X&quot;), voice activated door locks (Gulch power station), motors powered by [[static electricity]], palm-activated door locks (Galt's NY lab), shale-oil drilling, and a [[nerve]]-induction [[torture]] machine.
 
===Traffic Signals===
Early on, the book mentions the &quot;screech&quot; of a traffic signal as it changes. This implies the older technology of mechanical traffic signals, the kind which displayed a pennant or flag indicating stop or go, and the inverse indicator in the opposite direction. Traffic signals using lights have been around for over 40 years, so anything of this type is very old compared to today.

===Project X===
Project X is an invention of the scientists at the state science institute, requiring tons of Rearden Metal. Basically, it is a &quot;death ray&quot;, and is capable of destroying anything. The scientists claim that the project will be used to preserve peace and squash rebellion. It is destroyed towards the end of the book, and emits a pulse of radiation that destroys everything in the surrounding area, including Cuffy Meigs and Dr. Stadler, as well as the Taggart Bridge.

===Rearden Metal===
Rearden metal is a [[Fictional_chemical_substance#Fictional_compounds_and_alloys|fictitious metal]] alloy invented by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]].  It is lighter than traditional [[steel]] but stronger, and is to steel what steel was to [[iron]].  It is described as greenish-blue.  Among its ingredients are iron and [[copper]].

Initially no one is willing to use Rearden metal because no one wants to stick his neck out and be the first to try it.  Finally, [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] places an order for Rearden Metal when she needs rails to rebuild the dying [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]].

The first thing made from Rearden metal is a [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|bracelet]].

Rearden metal is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 114, 121, 131, 148 and 161.

===Galt's Motor===
John Galt invented a new type of electrical apparatus described in the book as a [[motor]].  However, it does not operate like a motor in the common use of the word today:  it is capable of harnessing, transforming and applying energy in many ways other than mechanical.  Galt's Motor was capable of [[Radio jamming|jamming]] all [[radio receiver]]s on Earth, and completely destroying the contents of Galt's [[booby-trap]]ped laboratory without causing [[collateral damage|collateral structural damage]].


Though Rand describes it as turning [[static electricity ]] into useful [[mechanical work]], its operation is more reminiscent of modern speculation about [[zero-point energy]].

Dagny discovers a discarded prototype of the motor and it is superficially described in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] Part 1, Chapter 9.  Galt shows Dagny the motor and describes it in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] Part 3, Chapter 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Companies in Atlas Shrugged''', the [[Ayn Rand]] [[novel]], generally, are  divided into two groups, these that are operated by sympathetic characters are given the name of the owner, while companies operated by evil or incompetent characters are given generic names.  In [[Atlas Shrugged]] men who give their names to their companies all become [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Strikers]] in due time.

==Amalgamated Switch and Signal==
A company run by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Mr. Mowen]] and located in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Connecticut]].  They have supplied Taggart Transcontinental for generations.  [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] orders [[Technology in Atlas_Shrugged|Rearden Metal]] switches from them.

Amalgamated Switch and Signal appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==Associated Steel==
Associated Steel is the company owned by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Orren Boyle]].  The company was started with just a few hundred-thousand dollars of [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Boyle's]] own money, and hundreds of millions of dollars in government grants.  Boyle used this money to buy out his competitors, and now relies on influence peddling and political favors to run his business.

Associated Steel is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 131 and 171.

==Ayers Music Publishing Company==
Ayers Music Publishing Company is the publisher of the music of [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Richard Halley]].  [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] contacts [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Mr. Ayers]] to inquire as to the existence of [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Halley's Fifth Concerto]].

Ayers Music Publishing Company is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 114.

==Barton and Jones==
The company, located in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Denver]], that supplies food for the workers rebuilding the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]].  They go bankrupt in the middle of the project.

Barton and James is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==d'Anconia Copper==
A copper and mining company founded by [[Minor Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Sebastian d'Anconia]] in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Argentina]] during the time of the Inquisition.  Each man who ran the company saw it grow by 10% in his lifetime, so by the time [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Francisco d'Anconia]] heads the company it is the largest in the world.  His dream, from childhood, is to increase the size of the company by 100%.

d'Anconia Copper is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 152 and 171.

==Hammond Motors==
A car company in Colorado.  They make the best cars on the market until the founder disappears.

[[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] buys a Hammond on his trip to [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==Incorporated Tool==
A company that is contracted to deliver drill heads to Taggart Transcontinental but who fail to do this.  It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==Phoenix-Durango==
The Phoenix-Durango is an old, small railroad located in the Southwest run by  [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dan Conway]] that has been insignificant for most of its existence.  However, the Phoenix-Durango grows rapidly when [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Ellis Wyatt]] revives the economy of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] and Taggart Transcontinental's [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]] fails to service Wyatt adequately.  Later, [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|James Taggart]] conspires to get the Phoenix-Durango driven out of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] with the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule]].

The Phoenix-Durango is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 131 (alluded to), 132, 145, 146, 147 and 152.

==Rearden Coal==
A business founded by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] prior to the founding of Rearden Steel.  It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121.

==Rearden Limestone==
A business founded by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] prior to the founding of Rearden Steel.  It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121.

==Rearden Ore==
The first business founded by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]].  It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121.

==Rearden Steel==
A company founded by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] about ten years prior to the start of the story in the novel.  Rearden bought an abandoned steel mill in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Philadelphia]] at a time when all the experts thought that such a venture would be hopeless.  He turned it into the most reliable and profitable steel company in the country.

As [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] struggles to save Taggart Transcontinental, she becomes increasingly dependent on Rearden Steel.

Rearden Steel is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 121, 131 (alluded to), 161 and 162.

==Summit Casting==
A company in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Illinois]] under contract to deliver rail spikes to Taggart Transcontinental.  They go bankrupt before they can deliver, prompting [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] to fly to [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Chicago]] and buy the company to get it started again.

Summit Casting is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 171.

==Taggart Transcontinental==
The fictional [[railroad]] run by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]].  Her commitment to the railroad creates one of the book's major conflicts.

Taggart Transcontinental was founded by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Nathaniel Taggart]] who lived three generations (or so) prior to Dagny's generation.  It was built without any grants, loans, or favors from the government, and was the last railroad that was still owned and controlled by its founder's descendants.  Its motto is, ''From Ocean to Ocean''.

The 'flagship' of Taggart Transcontinental is the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Taggart Comet]] which runs from [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|New York]] to [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|San Francisco]], and which has never been late.

==United Locomotive Works==
An incompetent company that is supposed to deliver Diesel engines to Taggart Transcontinental. The order is delayed in perpetuity, and the [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|president]] of the company refuses to ever give a straight answer as to why this is so.

The United Locomotive Works is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 133 and 141.

==Wyatt Oil==
The oil company run by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Ellis Wyatt]].  Wyatt's father had squeezed a living out of the oil fields in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]], but when Ellis Wyatt took over the business took off.  He discovered a technique for extracting oil from wells that had been abandoned as dried up.  The success of Wyatt Oil that followed this discovery suddenly and unexpectedly turned [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] into the leading economy in the country.

Wyatt Oil traditionally relied on Taggart Transcontinental's [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]] to ship its oil.  But when that company could not grow fast enough to keep up with the booming [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]] economy, Wyatt started using the small but well-managed Phoenix-Durango instead.  This prompted [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|James Taggart]] to make deals with his friends to drive the Phoenix-Durango out of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]].  Afterwards, [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]] has to rebuild the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]] so it can supply transportation to Wyatt Oil - if she fails, the economy of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]], and of the whole country, could collapse.

Wyatt Oil is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 132 and 171.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some of the important '''concepts''' discussed in [[Atlas Shrugged]] include  the ''Sanction of the Victim'' and the ''Theory of Sex''.

===Sanction of the Victim===

The Sanction of the Victim is defined as &quot;the willingness of the good to suffer at the hands of the [[evil]], to accept the role of sacrificial victim for the '[[sin]]' of creating values.&quot;

The entire story of Atlas Shrugged can be seen as an answer to the question, what would happen if this sanction was revoked?  When Atlas shrugs, relieving himself of the burden of carrying the world, he is revoking his sanction.

The concept is supposedly original in the thinking of [[Ayn Rand]] and is foundational to her moral theory.  She holds that evil is a parasite on the good and can only exist if the good tolerates it.  To quote from [[Atlas_Shrugged/Galts Speech|Galt's Speech]]: &quot;Evil is impotent and has no power but that which we let it extort from us&quot;, and, &quot;I saw that evil was impotent...and the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it.&quot;  Morality requires that we do not sanction our own victimhood, Rand claims.  In adhering to this concept, Rand assigns virtue to the trait of [[selfishness]].

Throughout Atlas Shrugged, numerous characters admit that there is something wrong with the world but they cannot put their finger on what it is.  The concept they cannot grasp is the sanction of the victim.  The first person to grasp the concept is [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|John Galt]], who vows to stop the motor of the world by getting the creators of the world to withhold their sanction.

We first glimpse the concept in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 121 when [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] feels he is duty-bound to support his family, despite their hostility towards him.

In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 146 the principle is stated explicitly by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Dan Conway]]: &quot;I suppose somebody's got to be sacrificed. If it turned out to be me, I have no right to complain.&quot;

===Theory of Sex===

In rejecting the traditional [[Christianity|Christian]] altruist [[moral code]], Rand also rejects the sexual code that, in her view, is a [[logical implication]] of [[altruism]].

Rand introduces a theory of sex in ''Atlas Shrugged'' which is purportedly implied by her broader ethical and psychological theories.  Far from being a debasing animal instinct, sex is the highest celebration of our greatest values.  Sex is a physical response to intellectual and spiritual values&amp;mdash;a mechanism for giving concrete expression to values that could otherwise only be experienced in the abstract.

One is sexually attracted to those who embody one's values.  Those who have base values will be attracted to baseness, to those who also have ignoble values.  Those who lack any clear purpose will find sex devoid of meaning.  People of high values will respond sexually to those who embody high values.

That our [[sexual desire]] is a response to the embodiment of our values in others is a radical and original theory.  However, even those who are sympathetic to this theory have criticized it as being incomplete.  For instance, since according to Rand the economy is also such an expression of values, and since it is always possible to encounter someone who embodies one's values more completely, this would seem to make [[family]] undesirable. (Indeed, Rand treats &quot;family&quot; as a sort of trap.) Furthermore, [[promiscuity]], [[prostitution]], and an endless [[round-robin]] of &quot;values-driven&quot; sexual relationships would become inevitable.  From this viewpoint, one could say that [[Aldous Huxley]] portrayed the ideal sexual state: ''[[Brave New World]]'' features humans who are incapable of deviating from their caste-oriented &quot;values&quot;, which naturally include a code of sexual desirability.

Her sexual theory is illustrated in the contrasting relationships of [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Hank Rearden]] with [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Lillian Rearden]] and [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]], and later with Dagny Taggart and [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|John Galt]].  

Other important illustrations of this theory are found in:

[[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|Section]] 152 - recounts Dagny's relationship with [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|Francisco d'Anconia]].

[[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|Section]] 161 - recounts Hank and Lillian Rearden's courtship, and Lillian's attitude towards sex.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a list of general items in [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''.

{{spoiler}}

==Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule==

The Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is passed by the National Alliance of Railroads in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 145, allegedly to prevent &quot;destructive competition&quot; between [[railroad]]s.  The rule gives the Alliance the authority to forbid competition between railroads in certain parts of the country.  It was crafted by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Orren Boyle|Orren Boyle]] as a favor for [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#James Taggart|James Taggart]], with the purpose of driving the [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Phoenix-Durango|Phoenix-Durango]] out of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged#Colorado|Colorado]].

==Bracelet==

The very first thing made from ''Rearden Metal'' is a bracelet.  The bracelet is used to illustrate Rand's [[Concepts in Atlas Shrugged#Theory of Sex|Theory of Sex]].

The bracelet symbolizes the value created by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Hank Rearden|Hank Rearden's]] long struggle to invent Rearden Metal.  When he gives it to [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Lillian Rearden|Lillian Rearden]] as a present in section 121; she says, &quot;It's fully as valuable as a piece of railroad rails.&quot;  However, Lillian fully grasps the significance of the gift; her snide remark is her way of denigrating her husband's ethos.

In section 161, Lillian wears this bracelet at a party thrown on her anniversary.  She makes fun of it all night long, and when [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart]] hears Lillian say she would gladly trade it for a common diamond bracelet, Dagny takes her up on it.

Lillian later asks for it back upon realizing her power over her husband was slowly diminishing.  Dagny denies the offer.

The bracelet appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 121 and 161.

==Cub Club==

A night club in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|New York]].  When [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]] returns to New York in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141, he explains he came because of a hat-check girl at the Cub Club and the liverwurst at Moe's Delicatessen on Third Avenue.

==Equalization of Opportunity Bill==

A bill designed by the [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Looters|Looters]] that proposes to limit the number of businesses any one person can own to one.  It is aimed primarily at [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Hank Rearden|Hank Rearden]], who uses [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Rearden Ore|Rearden Ore]] to guarantee [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Rearden Steel|Rearden Steel]] with a supply of iron ore.  By passing this Bill, the Looters can seize Rearden's other businesses for themselves, and then deny him the iron he needs to run his steel mills.

The Looters claim the Bill is meant to give a chance to the little guy.

The Equalization of Opportunity Bill is appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==Galt's Gulch==

A secluded refuge in a valley of Colorado where the men of ability have retreated after relinquishing participation in American society.  Nicknamed &quot;Galt's Gulch&quot; by its inhabitants, it is in fact the property of &quot;Midas&quot; Mulligan, one of the early strikers to follow John Galt's call. This call was to the great men of mind and action to abandon the increasingly slave-state inclinations of a decaying United States - to go on strike - thereby withdrawing the only thing supporting the parasites and looters.

Sarcastically nicknamed Midas in the press because everything he seemed to touch turned to gold, Mulligan adopted the nickname during his explosive investment career before dropping out of sight.  He had purchased this land among his far-ranging speculative endeavors, and subsequently retreated to it upon his disappearance.  Other strikers soon followed him there, including John Galt, renting or buying land for summer retreats as a respite from continuing their search for fellow strikers among the increasingly collapsing American society.  Eventually, a society develops in Galt's Gulch as more people live there year-round as the outside world becomes virtually unsafe to visit.

We are introduced to Galt's Gulch in the final section of the Novel, in the first chapter, entitled Atlantis.  The people live with each other in completely free society and embody everything which is the thesis of the Novel, the appropriate values for a society of Mankind: philosophical, moral, economic, legal, aesthetic, and sexual, among others too numerous to mention.

We find industrious, ambitious, happy people continuing their chosen fields of endeavor without the yokes of any taxation or regulation.  Conversely, there is a reverence for private property; everything transacted is paid for with the re-invented currency of solid gold coin struck from the reserves of Midas Mulligan's bank which now resides in the valley.  The townspeople receive services from the various heroes we have met throughout the Novel, who all now reside and produce in the valley. They purchase power inexpensively from Galt and his invention of the static electricity motor, maintain their anonymity from the outside world via Galt's invention of the air-wave reflection device (giving the view from above the camouflage of reflected images of other mountainsides nearby), and some attend Galt's lectures on Physics, where he explains his discoveries on new fundamental laws and applied mathematics.  The people purchase medical treatment from the care of Dr. Hendricks, who uses his invention of a portable [[X-ray]] machine to initially diagnose Dagny Taggart upon her crash landing into the valley, attend concerts of new musical compositions of Richard Halley who has continued to compose in the Valley, acquire raw materials from the efforts of Francisco D'Anconia's excavations around the valley, attend philosophy lectures from the now-retired pirate Ragnar Danneskjöld, receive loans from Midas Mulligan, etc.

Rand's description of Galt's Gulch was inspired by a visit she and her husband Frank O'Connor took to [[Ouray, Colorado]] while researching Colorado for the novel.

==Halley's Fifth Concerto==

[[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Richard Halley|Richard Halley]] disappeared after he had written only four concertos.  In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 112, [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart]], an enthusiastic fan of Halley's music, hears an unfamiliar theme being whistled by a [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Brakeman|brakeman]] on the Taggart Comet.  She asks him what it is; he responds Halley's Fifth Concerto.  When Dagny says Halley only wrote four concertos, the brakeman says he made a mistake and denies knowing what the song was.

Later, Dagny calls [[Minor characters in Atlas Shrugged|Mr. Ayers]] to find out if Halley wrote a fifth concerto. Ayers says Halley did not.

Halley's Fifth Concerto is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 112, 114 and 152.

==Halley's Fourth Concerto==

The last thing [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Richard Halley|Richard Halley]] wrote before he disappeared.  It is a song of rebellion and defiance that seemed to say agony and suffering were not necessary.  [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart]] listened to this piece in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141.

It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152.

==''Heaven's In Your Backyard''==

A film.  [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Mort Liddy|Mort Liddy]] wrote the score, using a bastardized version of ''Halley's Fourth Concerto''.  It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==John Galt Legends==

Since everyone across the country is asking, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;, it is not surprising that some people have come up with answers.  A number of John Galt Legends are told, each of which, ironically, turns out to be true, at least symbolically.

'''''Legend 1''''' ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161):  A [[Minor characters in Atlas Shrugged|spinster]] at [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Lillian Rearden|Lillian Rearden's]] party tells [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Dagny Taggart|Dagny]] the story.  John Galt was a man of inestimable wealth who found the sunken island of [[Atlantis]] while fighting the worst storm ever wreaked upon the world.  The sight was so beautiful that, having seen it, he could never go back to the world, so he sank his ship and took his fortune down with him.

The actual John Galt was a man who created something of inestimable value, a new motor, and who discovered the secret to what was wrong with the world while fighting the most evil social philosophy ever put into practice.  The world he envisioned was so beautiful that he refused to live in the world that was, and disappeared, taking the secret of motor with him.

Atlantis, the Isles of the Blessed, is a place where no one could enter except those who had the spirit of a hero.  Described in these terms, it is the same as ''Galt's Gulch''.

==Moe's Delicatessen==

A delicatessen in [[Places in Atlas Shrugged#New York|New York]].  When [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]] returns to New York in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141, he explains he came because of a hat-check girl at the ''Cub Club'' and the liverwurst at Moe's Delicatessen on Third Avenue.

==National Alliance of Railroads==

An industry group formed to promote the welfare of the industry as a whole, requiring members to sacrifice their individual interests for the common good.  [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Orren Boyle|Orren Boyle]] has friends on the National Alliance of Railroads, and he gets them to support the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule, which uses a string of pretenses to drive the [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Phoenix-Durango|Phoenix-Durango]] out of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged#Colorado|Colorado]].

The National Alliance of Railroads is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 131, 145 and 146.

==National Council of Metal Industries==

An industry group that uses political pull to get its way. [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#James Taggart|James Taggart]] has friends on the National Council of Metal Industries, and he gets them to support legislation that will hurt [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Rearden Steel|Rearden Steel]] and help [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Associated Steel|Associated Steel]].
 
The National Council of Metal Industries is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 131.

==Patrick Henry University==

The most prestigious university in the world.  It was attended by [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged|John Galt]], [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]], and [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Ragnar_Danneskj.F6ld|Ragnar Danneskjold]], where they met and became friends.  [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Hugh Akston|Hugh Akston]] and [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Robert Stadler|Robert Stadler]] taught there.  It is located in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Cleveland]].

==Rio Norte Line==

A branch of [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental]] that runs from [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Cheyenne, Wyoming]] to [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|El Paso, Texas]].

It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 114, 131 (alluded to), 132, 133, 141, 146, 147 and 148.

==Rockdale Station==

A station on the [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental]] line, located five miles from the Taggart estate and overlooking the [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Hudson River]].  It was the site of [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart's]] first job with the railroad, night operator, at age 16.

It appears in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152.

==San Sebastian==

A community built to house the workers of the ''San Sebastian Mines'' and their families.  As it turns out, the houses, roads, and everything of practical value is built so poorly that the community can be expected to fall apart within a year or two.  Only the church was built to last.

It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152.

==San Sebastian Line==

A branch of [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental]] that serves the ''San Sebastian Mines'' in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Mexico]].

The mines were developed by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]] and attracted significant investments from [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#James Taggart|James Taggart]] and [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Orren Boyle|Orren Boyle]], who assumed Francisco could be counted on to deliver a winner.

The San Sebastian Line is nationalized by the Mexican government soon after completion.

When it is nationalized in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 142, it is referred to as the San Sebastian Railroad.

It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 114, 131, 132, 133, 142, 143 and 152.

==San Sebastian Mines==

San Sebastian Mines is a copper mining project in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Mexico]] founded by [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]] and named after his ancestor [[Minor characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Sebastian d'Anconia]].  Francisco's reputation as a businessman is so great that investors flock to him, begging to invest money in the enterprise.  Investors include [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#James Taggart|James Taggart]] and [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Orren Boyle|Orren Boyle]]. Taggart goes so far as to build a new branch of [[Companies in Atlas_Shrugged#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental]], the ''San Sebastian Line'', to serve the mines, sinking $30 million into the project.  When the development of the mines appears complete, the Mexican government nationalizes them as well as the ''San Sebastian Line'', only to discover there is no copper and there never was.

When Taggart tells Francisco he considers the Mines a rotten swindle ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161), Francisco explains that Taggart should be pleased with the way he ran the mines.  He says he put into practice those moral precepts that were accepted around the world.  The world says it is evil to pursue a profit &amp;mdash; he got no profit from the worthless mines.  The world says the purpose of an enterprise is not to produce, but to give a livelihood to its employees &amp;mdash; it produced nothing, but created jobs that would never have existed if one was only concerned with developing a real mine.  The world says the owner is an exploiter and the workers do all the real work &amp;mdash; he left the enterprise entirely in the hands of the workers and did not burden anyone with his presence.  The world says need is more important than ability &amp;mdash; he hired a mining specialist who needed a job very badly, but had no ability.

In short, the San Sebastian Mines were an illustration of what happens when this moral code is put into practice, and a warning of what will soon happen to the world as a whole.

The San Sebastian Mines appear in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|sections]] 111, 131, 132, 142, 151, 152 and 161.

It is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161.

==The Octopus==

See [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Bertram Scudder|Bertram Scudder]].

==''The Vulture Is Molting''==

A best-selling novel that captures the spirit of the times, ''The Vulture Is Molting'' is &quot;A penetrating study of a businessman's greed.  A fearless revelation of man's depravity.&quot;  The book is mentioned in [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 141 as one of the artifacts of [[popular culture]] that depresses [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged#Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart]] with its baseness.

==Wayne-Falkland Hotel==

A luxurious hotel in [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|New York]], it is considered the best hotel left in the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Atlas===
As told in ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', Atlas carried the world on his shoulders. But in the [[Greek Mythology|Greek Myths]], the Titan [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] stands on the earth and holds up the sky. In the statues that represent Atlas, the big round thing on his back represents the heavens, which, because of the apparent circular motion of the planets around the earth, were conceived of as being round. Some tellings of the Atlas myth have him carrying both the earth and the heavens on his back, but this appears to be a modern retelling; further research might confirm this.

===Character names===
Some of the character names are, or appear to be, puns, or have some other significance.  (See also [[Characters in Atlas Shrugged]].)
When asked why so many of her names have syllables with many hard consonants like dag, tag, den, stad, Rand said that she just liked those sounds.

*'''Ragnar Danneskjold''' - sounds like 'Dane's Gold', a tribute paid by the medieval English to the Vikings to bribe them into being peaceful.  (However, note &quot;skjold&quot; means shield, not gold.)  However, the hero of [[Victor Hugo]]'s first novel, ''Hans of Iceland'' becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskjöld.  In the 1970's, Rand told Marsha Familaro Enright that her use of this name was not plagiarism because there really were Counts of Danneskjöld.
*'''Robert Stadler''' - sounds like the German word for state, Staat. Dr. Stadler is a statist, in that he believes it appropriate and necessary for the state to fund scientific research.
*'''Francisco d'Anconia''' - Rand's husband was Frank O'Connor.
*'''John Galt''' - the name of a 19th century Scottish novelist, though this is apparently coincidental. Galt is close to 'Geld' and 'gold'. The name was probably used because it had to be such that it could become proverbial&amp;mdash;this would not be possible with a long, awkward name.
*'''Wesley Mouch''' - Mouch is exactly what his name sounds like, a mooch.  He has no real virtue or skill, but somehow becomes a powerful figure.

===Crime===
Common street crime is conspicuously absent in ''Atlas Shrugged''. Characters walk the streets with no thought of being mugged or attacked.

===Historical figures and events===
''Atlas Shrugged'' takes place in a world with a different history from our own, but there are some historical figures and events that are mentioned.

*[[Aristotle]] ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152): Francisco d'Anconia wrote a thesis on the influence of Aristotle's theory of the Immovable Mover.
*[[Dark Ages]] ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161): Ragnar Danneskjold's piracy is likened to something out of the Dark Ages.
*[[Inquisition]] ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152): Sebastian d'Anconia flees Spain to escape persecution under the Inquisition.
*[[Middle Ages]] ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161): It is said that Ragnar Danneskjold hides in the Norwegian fjords as the Vikings did in the Middle Ages.
*[[Nero]] ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152): Francisco d'Anconia compares himself to the Emperor Nero.
*[[Patrick Henry]] ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152): The [[eponym]] of Patrick Henry University.
*[[Vikings]] ([[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 161): It is said that Ragnar Danneskjold hides in the Norwegian fjords as the Vikings did in the Middle Ages.

===Humor===
In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152, Francisco cracks that the Mexican government was promising a roast of pork every Sunday for every man, woman, child and abortion.

In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152, Francisco lists the various buildings constructed for the workers of the San Sebastian Mines, and notes how they are all poorly built and can be expected to collapse, except for the church. &quot;The church, I think, will stand. They'll need it,&quot; he quips. Since the other things are things of value&amp;mdash;houses, roads, etc.&amp;mdash;it is ironic that only the church was built to last; to Rand and her heroes, a church is of no real value.

Almost every nation in the world except the United States is referred to as &quot;The People's State of...&quot;, and they are all, apparently, the recipients of relief supplies from the United States. In conversation, people casually refer to them as &quot;The People's State of...&quot; rather than just, say, France or Norway. It is obvious that people would not refer to countries by their formal names in casual conversation&amp;mdash;we don't call Canada &quot;The Dominion of Canada&quot; or Germany &quot;The Federal Republic of Germany&quot;&amp;mdash;so by having her characters do this Rand is exercising her dry wit.

===Lying===
The sympathetic characters of ''Atlas Shrugged'' generally do not tell lies. With the following exceptions, even when they are clearly trying to conceal something, they do not rely on overt falsehood, even when it is obvious that they could do so without being found out.

*In section 112 Brakeman tells Dagny Taggart he does not recall the name of the song he was whistling or where he heard it.
*In section 141 Francisco d'Anconia tells the press he came to [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|New York]] because of a hat check girl and the liverwurst at [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Moe's Delicatessen]].
*In section 151 we learn Dagny Taggart once lied to her mother about a cut to her lip that Francisco had given her. This was the only lie she ever told.
*In section 152 Dagny Taggart asks Francisco if Richard Halley has written a fifth concerto. He is evasive and tells her that Halley has stopped writing. Is this a lie?
*In section 161, Hank Rearden tells Dagny that he was the one who invited Bertram Scudder to the Rearden's anniversary party. It was actually Lillian who invited him, and Rearden had been furious about it.
*In part 2/chapter 9, Eddie Willers tells Dagny Taggart that his hesitation and uncertainty is caused by the illegality of her directions.  In fact, Eddie was shocked by the evidence and thus realization of her affair with Hank Rearden.

===People's States===
Almost every nation that is mentioned, other than the [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|United States]], is referred to as a &quot;People's State&quot;. These include:

* The People's State of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|England]]
* The People's State of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|France]]
* The People's State of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|India]]
* The People's State of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Mexico]]
* The People's State of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Norway]]
* The People's State of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Portugal]]
* The People's State of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|Turkey]]

The leaders of these countries are given the title the &quot;Head of the People's State,&quot; and called &quot;Mr._____&quot; (or &quot;Senor&quot;____). The President of the United States is refered to as &quot;Mr. Thompson&quot; and called the &quot;Head of the State,&quot; which seems to imply the US is on its way to becoming a People's State as well. 

===Religion===
In [[Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152 Francisco tells Dagny he named the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|San Sebastian Mines]] after his ancestor Sebastian d'Anconia, a man they both honor deeply. This, to Dagny, is blasphemy&amp;mdash;the only kind of blasphemy she understands.

===Social classes===
Rand is sometimes called an elitist. This claim is probably accurate if we allow for the fact that Rand had her own standard of eliteness&amp;mdash;throughout ''Atlas Shrugged'', virtue is equated with creative ability.  It is, however, worth noting that in ''Atlas Shrugged'', there are no characters with creative ability which do not function as [[author surrogate]] characters (most notably Dagny Taggart); conversely, all of the [[Straw man|characters]] which disagree with the author are unintelligent and creatively bankrupt, and usually actively destructive.  Compare to the real world, where scientists, inventors, artists and industrialists often have wildly varying and strongly conflicting desires and opinions.

Different social classes are represented among both the heroes and the villains of ''Atlas Shrugged''. Among the heroes, John Galt and Hank Rearden are from working class backgrounds, while Dagny Taggart and Francisco d'Anconia are from wealthy families. Among the villains, Fred Kinnan is from a working class background, while James Taggart and Betty Pope are from wealthy families.

'''''Atlas Shrugged''''' is a novel by Russian-born writer and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]], first published in [[1957]] in the [[United States|USA]], and Rand's last work of fiction before concentrating her writings exclusively on philosophy.  Most regard ''Atlas Shrugged'' as Rand's most famous work, her ''tour de force'', and most [[Objectivist philosophy|Objectivists]] hold it to be, objectively (as in factually), the greatest novel of all time. Its theme (as stated by Rand) is &quot;the importance of the individual's reasoning mind in human life.&quot;

It is a highly philosophical and [[allegory|allegorical]] story that deals with themes of Rand's own [[Objectivism]], though she was not yet known as a philosopher when it was written. Whether or not she had philosophical intentions, and to what extent or sense the novel is an allegory, are controversial subjects. In fact, the ideas behind the book, and their extremism, as well as its relative popularity have made it one of the most controversial novels of the [[20th century]]. It is also one of the [[List_of_longest_novels|longest novels]] ever written, totaling one-thousand pages or more (depending on the publication).
 
{{spoiler}}

==Philosophy and writing==

The theme of ''Atlas Shrugged'' is that independent, rational thought is the motor that powers the world. In the book, &quot;men of the mind&quot; go on [[Strike action|strike]], allowing the collapse of what only they hold together &amp;#8212; a peaceful cohesiveness Rand claims that humans, particularly those whose productive work comes from mental effort, may create wherever forceful human interference is absent. Given no alternative, they remove themselves from the &quot;looters.&quot; The title is an analogy: the rational men, like the Greek God Atlas, hold the world on their shoulders; in the form of a strike, they have chosen to 'shrug.' The book is rooted in [[Objectivist philosophy|Objectivism]], the philosophical system founded by Rand.

Rand suggests that society stagnates when independence and individual achievement are discouraged or demonized, and that, inversely, a society will become more prosperous as it allows, encourages, and rewards independence and individual achievement. Rand believed that independence flourishes to the extent that people are free, and that achievement is rewarded best when [[private property]] is respected strictly. She advocated [[Laissez-faire|laissez-faire capitalism]] as the [[political system]] that is most consistent with these beliefs. These considerations make ''Atlas Shrugged'' a highly political book, especially in its portrayal of [[fascism]], [[socialism]] and [[communism]], or indeed any form of state intervention in societal affairs, as fatally flawed. However, Rand claimed that it is not a ''fundamentally'' political book, but that the politics portrayed in the novel are a result of her attempt to display her image of the ideal man and the position of the human mind in society.

Rand argues that independence and individual achievement drive the world, and should be embraced. Her worldview requires a &quot;[[rationality|rational]]&quot; [[moral code]]. She disputes the notion that [[self-sacrifice]] is a virtue, and is similarly dismissive of human faith in a [[divinity|god]] or higher being. The book positions itself against [[Christianity]] specifically, often directly within the characters' dialogue.

== Setting ==

Exactly when ''Atlas Shrugged'' is meant to take place is kept deliberately vague. In [[Wikibooks:Structure of Atlas Shrugged|section]] 152, the population of [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|New York City]] is given as 7 [[million]]. The historical New York City reached 7 million people in the [[1930s]], which might place the novel sometime after that. There are many early [[20th century]] technologies available, but the political situation is clearly different from actual history. One interpretation is that the novel takes place a hundred (or perhaps ''hundreds'') of years in the future, implying that since the world lapsed into its socialistic morass, a global-wide stagnation has occurred in technological growth, population growth, and indeed growth of ''any'' kind; the wars, economic depressions, and other events of the 20th century would be a distant memory to all but [[scholar]]s and [[academician]]s. This would be in line with Rand's ideas and commentary on other novels depicting utopian and dystopian societies. Furthermore, this is also in line with an excerpt from a 1964 interview with ''Playboy'' magazine in which Rand states &quot;What we have today is not a capitalist society, but a mixed economy -- that is, a mixture of freedom and controls, which, by the presently dominant trend, is moving toward dictatorship. The action in ''Atlas Shrugged'' takes place at a time when society has reached the stage of dictatorship. When and if this happens, that will be the time to go on strike, but not until then.&quot;, thus implying that her novel takes place at some point in the future. The concept of societal stagnation in the wake of collectivist systems is central to the plot of another of Rand's works, ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]''.

All countries outside the US have become, or become during the novel, &quot;People's States&quot;. There are many examples of early 20th century [[Technology in Atlas_Shrugged|technology]] in ''Atlas Shrugged'', but no post-war advances such as [[nuclear weapon]]s, [[helicopter]]s, or [[computer]]s. [[Jet plane]]s are mentioned briefly as being a relatively new technology. [[Television]] is a novelty that has yet to assume any cultural significance, while [[radio]] broadcasts are prominent. Though Rand does not use in the book many of the technological innovations available while she was writing, she introduces some advanced, fictional inventions (e.g., sound-based [[weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], torture devices, as well as power plants).

Most of the action in ''Atlas Shrugged'' occurs in the [[Places in Atlas_Shrugged|United States]]. However, there are important events around the world, such as in the People's States of [[Mexico]], [[Chile]], and [[Argentina]], and [[piracy]] at sea.

==Plot==

A section by section analysis of ''Atlas Shrugged'' is available on [[Wikibooks:Atlas Shrugged|Wikibooks]].

The novel’s plot, split into three sections (though the story is coherent apart from these,) is extremely complex. The first two sections, and to some extent the last, follow Dagny Taggart, a no-nonsense railroad executive, and her attempt to keep the company alive despite the fact that society is falling towards collectivism/altruism/statism. All throughout the novel people repeat a platitude Dagny greatly resents: ‘Who is John Galt?’ It is a reflection of their helplessness, as the saying means ‘Don’t ask important questions, because they don’t have answers.’ 

The geniuses of the world seem to be disappearing, and the apparent decline of civilization is making it more and more difficult for her to sustain her life-long aspirations of running the trans-continental railroad, which has been in her family for several generations. She deals with other characters such as Hank Rearden, a self-made businessman of great integrity whose career is hindered by his false feelings of obligation towards his wife. Francisco d'Anconia, Dagny’s childhood friend, first love, and king of the copper industry, appears to have become a worthless playboy who is purposely destroying his business. 

As the novel progresses: the myths about the real John Galt, as well as Francisco d'Anconia’s actions, become more and more a reflection of the state of the culture, and seem to make more and more sense; and, Hank and Dagny begin to experience the futility of their attempts to survive in a society that hates them and those like them for their greatness. 

During their plight, Dagny and Hank find the remnants of a motor that turns atmospheric energy into kinetic energy, an astounding feat; they also find evidence that the minds (the ‘Atlases’) of the world are disappearing because of one particular ‘destroyer’ taking them away. Dagny and Hank deal with the irrationalities and apparent contradictions of their atmosphere, and search for the creator of the motor as well as ‘the destroyer’ who is draining the world of its prime movers, in an effort to secure their ability to live rational lives.

All of this leads to an elaborate action-based explanation and eventual climax, presenting an understanding of all of the issues explored, and breaking everything down into one basic conflict. The final parts of the novel involve a speech by the story's true protagonist, and a resolution concerning the fate of society. The question 'Who is John Galt' is also answered.

==Film adaptation==
Rights to the novel ''Atlas Shrugged'' were purchased by the Baldwin Entertainment Group in [[2003]] with the intent of producing a feature-length film. Company leader [[Howard Baldwin]] was quoted in September 2004 as saying &quot;...everything is on track and [the movie] hasn’t been held up one bit... I assure you that this will be a big movie and ''it will get made''.&quot; Two works of Rand's&amp;mdash;''[[The Fountainhead]]'' and ''[[We the Living]]''&amp;mdash;have been adapted into movies so far.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anthropology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''άνθρωπος'', &quot;human&quot; or &quot;person&quot;) consists of the study of [[humanity]] (see genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'').  It is [[holism|holistic]] in two senses: it is concerned with all humans at all times and with all dimensions of humanity.  A primary trait that traditionally distinguished anthropology from other humanistic disciplines is an emphasis on cultural relativity, indepth examination of context, and cross cultural comparisons.  

In [[North America]], &quot;anthropology&quot; is traditionally divided into four sub-disciplines: 
* [[physical anthropology]] or [[biological anthropology]], which studies [[primatology|primate behavior]], [[human evolution]], [[osteology]], [[forensics]] and [[population genetics]]; 
* [[cultural anthropology]], (called [[social anthropology]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and now often known as [[socio-cultural anthropology]]).  Areas studied by cultural anthropologists include social networks, [[diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]], social behavior, [[kinship]] patterns, law, politics, [[ideology]], religion, beliefs, patterns in production and consumption, exchange, socialization, gender, and other expressions of culture, with strong emphasis on the importance of [[fieldwork]] or participant-observation (i.e living among the social group being studied for an extended period of time); 
* [[linguistic anthropology]], which studies variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture; and
* [[archaeology]], that studies the material remains of human [[society|societies]]. Archaeology itself is normally treated as a separate (but related) field in the rest of the world, although closely related to the anthropological field of [[material culture]], which deals with physical objects created or used within a living or past group as mediums of understanding its cultural values.

More recently, some anthropology programs began dividing the field into two, one emphasizing the [[humanities]] and [[critical theory]], the other emphasizing the [[natural science]]s and [[empiricism|empirical observation]].

==Historical and institutional context==
:''Main Article: [[History of anthropology]]''
The anthropologist [[T J Brewer]] once characterized anthropology as the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences.  Understanding how anthropology developed contributes to understanding how it fits into other academic disciplines.

Contemporary anthropologists claim a number of earlier thinkers as their forebearers and the discipline has several sources. However, anthropology can best be understood as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It was during this period that Europeans attempted systematically to study human behavior. Traditions of [[jurisprudence]], [[history]], [[philology]] and [[sociology]] developed during this time and informed the development of the [[social sciences]] of which anthropology was a part. At the same time, the [[romanticism|romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as [[Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] whose work formed the basis for the culture concept which is central to the discipline.

Institutionally anthropology emerged from [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]). This was the study of human beings - typically people living in European [[colonialism|colonies]]. Thus studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was more or less equivalent to studying the flora and fauna of those places. It was for this reason, for instance, that [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] could write monographs on both ''The League of the Iroquois'' and ''The American Beaver and His Works''. This is also why the material culture of 'civilized' nations such as China have historically been displayed in fine arts museums alongside European art while artifacts from Africa or Native North American cultures were displayed in Natural History Museums with dinosaur bones and nature dioramas. This being said, curatorial practice has changed dramatically in recent years, and it would be wrong to see anthropology as merely an extension of colonial rule and European [[chauvinism]], since its relationship to [[imperialism]] was and is complex.

Anthropology grew increasingly distinct from natural history and by the end of the nineteenth century the discipline began to crystallize into its modern form - by 1935, for example, it was possible for T.K. Penniman to write a history of the discipline entitled ''A Hundred Years of Anthropology''. Early anthropology was dominated by 'the comparative method'. It was assumed that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process from the most primitive to most advanced. Non-European societies were thus seen as evolutionary 'living fossils' that could be studied in order to understand the European past. Scholars wrote histories of prehistoric migrations which were sometimes valuable but often also fanciful. It was during this time that Europeans first accurately traced [[polynesia|Polynesian]] migrations across the [[Pacific Ocean]] for instance - although some of them believed it originated in [[Egypt]]. Finally, the concept of [[race]] was actively discussed as a way to classify - and rank - human beings based on inherent biological difference.

In the twentieth century academic disciplines began to organize around three main domains. The &quot;[[sciences]]&quot; seeks to derive natural laws through reproducible and falsifiable experiments. The &quot;[[humanities]]&quot; reflected an attempt to study different national traditions, in the form of [[history]] and the [[art]]s, as an attempt to provide people in emerging nation-states with a sense of coherence. The &quot;[[social sciences]]&quot; emerged at this time as an attempt to develop scientific methods to address social phenomena, in an attempt to provide a universal basis for social knowledge. Anthropology does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.

Drawing on the methods of the [[natural science]]s as well as developing new techniques involving not only structured interviews but unstructured &quot;participant-observation&quot; – and drawing on the new [[theory of evolution]] through [[natural selection]], they proposed the scientific study of a new object: &quot;humankind,&quot; conceived of as a whole.  Crucial to this study is the concept &quot;culture,&quot; which anthropologists defined both as a universal capacity and propensity for social learning, thinking, and acting (which they see as a product of human evolution and something that distinguishes Homo sapiens – and perhaps all species of genus ''[[Hominoid|Homo]]'' – from other species), and as a particular adaptation to local conditions that takes the form of highly variable beliefs and practices.  Thus, &quot;culture&quot; not only transcends the opposition between nature and nurture; it transcends and absorbs the peculiarly European distinction between politics, religion, kinship, and the economy as autonomous domains.  Anthropology thus transcends the divisions between the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to explore the biological, linguistic, material, and symbolic dimensions of humankind in all forms.

==Anthropology in the U.S.==
Anthropology in the United States was pioneered by staff of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Smithsonian Institution's Bureau of American Ethnology, such as John Wesley Powell and Frank Hamilton Cushing.  Academic Anthropology was established by [[Franz Boas]], who used his positions at [[Columbia University]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to train and develop multiple generations of students. Boasian anthropology was politically active and suspicious of research dictated by the U.S. government or wealthy patrons. It was also rigorously empirical and skeptical of over-generalizations and attempts to establish universal laws. Boas studied immigrant children in order to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable and that human conduct and behavior was the result of nurture rather than nature. 

Drawing on his German roots, he argued that the world was full of distinct 'cultures' rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little 'civilization' they had. Boas felt that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations like those made in the [[natural science]]s were not possible. In doing so Boas fought discrimination against immigrants, African Americans, and Native North Americans. Many American anthropologists adopted Boas' agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular targets for anthropologists today.

Boas's first generation of students included [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. All of these scholars produced richly detailed studies which described Native North America. In doing so they provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages also helped establish [[linguistics]] as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on [[Indo-European languages]].

The publication of [[Alfred Kroeber]]'s textbook ''Anthropology'' marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material the urge to generalize grew. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up. While such works as ''Coming of Age in Samoa'' and ''The Chrysanthemum and the Sword'' remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined by [[Ralph Linton]] and Mead was limited to her offices at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]].

==Anthropology in Britain==
Whereas Boas picked his opponents to pieces through attention to detail, in Britain modern anthropology was formed by rejecting historical reconstruction in the name of a science of society that focused on analyzing how societies held together in the present.

The two most important names in this tradition were [[Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown]] and [[Bronislaw Malinowski]], both of whom released seminal works in 1922. Radcliffe-Brown's initial fieldwork in the [[Andaman Islands]] was carried out in the old style, but after reading [[Émile Durkheim]] he published an account of his research (entitled simply ''The Andaman Islanders'') which drew heavily on the French sociologist. Over time he developed an approach known as structural-functionalism, which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. [[Bronislaw Malinowski|Malinowski]], on the other hand, advocated an unhyphenated 'functionalism' which examined how society functioned to meet individual needs. Malinowski is best known not for his theory, however, but for his detailed [[ethnography]] and advances in methodology. His classic ''Argonauts of the Western Pacific'' advocated getting 'the native's point of view' and an approach to field work that became standard in the field.

Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown's success stem from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions which furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for 'Social Anthropology' by teaching at universities across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. From the late 1930s until the post-war period a string of monographs and edited volumes appeared which cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology. Famous ethnographies include ''The Nuer'' by [[Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]] and ''The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi'' by [[Meyer Fortes]], while well known edited volumes include ''African Systems of Kinship and Marriage'' and ''African Political Systems''.

==Anthropology in France==
Anthropology in France has a less clear genealogy than the British and American traditions. Most commentators consider [[Marcel Mauss]] to be the founder of the French anthropological tradition. Mauss was a member of [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim's]] [[Annee Sociologique]] group, and while Durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies, Mauss and his collaborators (such as [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Robert Hertz]]) drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies which were not as 'differentiated' as European nation states. In particular, Mauss's ''Essay on the Gift'' was to prove of enduring relevance in anthropological studies of [[trade|exchange]] and [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]].

Throughout the interwar years, French interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as [[surrealism]] and [[primitivism (art movement)|primitivism]] which drew on ethnography for inspiration. [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Michel Leiris]] are examples of people who combined anthropology with the French avant-garde. During this time most of what is known as ''ethnologie'' was restricted to museums, and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of [[folklore]].

Above all, however, it was [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] who helped institutionalize anthropology in France. In addition to the enormous influence his [[structuralism]] exerted across multiple disciplines, Lévi-Strauss established ties with American and British anthropologists. At the same time he established centers and laboratories within France to provide an institutional context within anthropology while training influential students such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Francoise Heritier]] who would prove influential in the world of French anthropology. Much of the distinct character of France's anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally-funded research laboratories rather than academic departments in universities.

==Anthropology after World War Two==
Before [[World War II|WWII]] British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. It was after the war that the two would blend to create a 'sociocultural' anthropology.

In the 1950s and mid-1960s anthropology tended increasingly to model itself after the [[natural science]]s. Some, such as [[Lloyd Fallers]] and [[Clifford Geertz]], focused on processes of modernization by which newly independent states could develop. Others, such as [[Julian Steward]] and [[Leslie White]] focused on how societies evolve and fit their ecological niche - an approach popularized by [[Marvin Harris]]. [[Economic anthropology]] as influenced by [[Karl Polanyi]] and practiced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[George Dalton]] focused on how traditional [[economics]] ignored cultural and social factors. In England, British Social Anthropology's paradigm began to fragment as [[Max Gluckman]] and [[Peter Worsley]] experimented with Marxism and authors such as [[Rodney Needham]] and [[Edmund Leach]] incorporated Lévi-Strauss's structuralism into their work.

Structuralism also influenced a number of development in 1960s and 1970s, including [[cognitive anthropology]] and componential analysis. Authors such as [[David Schneider]], [[Clifford Geertz]], and [[Marshall Sahlins]] developed a more fleshed-out concept of culture as a web of meaning or signification, which proved very popular within and beyond the discipline. In keeping with the times, much of anthropology became politicized through the [[Algerian War of Independence]] and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]]; [[Marxism]] became a more and more popular theoretical approach in the discipline. By the 1970s the authors of volumes such as ''Reinventing Anthropology'' worried about anthropology's relevance.

In the 1980s issues of power, such as those examined in [[Eric Wolf]]'s ''Europe and the People Without History'' - were central to the discipline. Books like ''Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter'' pondered anthropology's ties to colonial inequality, while the immense popularity of theorists such as [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Michel Foucault]] moved issues of power and hegemony into the spotlight. Gender and sexuality became a popular topic, as did the relationship between history and anthropology, influenced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] (again) who drew on [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Fernand Braudel]] to examine the relationship between social structure and individual agency. 

In the late 1980s and 1990s authors such as [[George Marcus]] and [[James Clifford]] pondered ethnographic authority, particularly how and why anthropological knowledge was possible and authoritative. Ethnographies became more reflexive, explicitly addressing the author's methodology and cultural positioning, and its influence on their ethnographic analysis. This was part of a more general trend of [[postmodernism]] that was popular contemporaneously. Currently anthropologists have begun to pay attention to globalization, medicine and biotechnology, indigenous rights, and the anthropology of Europe.

==Politics of anthropology==
Anthropology's traditional involvement with nonwestern cultures has involved it in politics in many different ways. 

Some political problems arise simply because anthropologists usually have more power than the people they study. Some have argued that the discipline is a form of colonialist theft in which the anthropologist gains power at the expense of subjects. The anthropologist, they argue, can gain yet more power by exploiting knowledge and artifacts of the people he studies while the people he studies gain nothing, or even lose, in the exchange. An example of this exploitative relationship can been seen in the collaboration in Africa prior to World War II of British anthropologists (such as Fortes) and colonial forces. More recently, there have been newfound concerns about bioprospecting, along with struggles for self-representation for native peoples and the repatriation of indigenous remains and material culture.

Other political controversies come from American anthropology's emphasis on cultural relativism and its long-standing antipathy to the concept of race. The development of [[sociobiology]] in the late 1960s was opposed by cultural anthropologists such as [[Marshall Sahlins]], who argued that these positions were reductive.  While authors such John Randal Baker continued to develop the biological concept of race into the 1970s, the rise of genetics has proven to be central to developments on this front. Recently, [[Kevin B. MacDonald]] criticized Boasian anthropology as part of a &quot;Jewish strategy to facilitate mass immigration and to weaken the West&quot; ([[The Culture of Critique]],2002). As genetics continues to advance as a science some anthropologists such as Luca [[Cavalli-Sforza]] have continued to transform and advance notions of race through the use of recent developments in genetics, such as tracing past migrations of peoples through their mitcochondial and Y-chromosomal DNA, and [[ancestry-informative marker]]s.

Finally, anthropology has a history of entanglement with government intelligence agencies and anti-war politics. Boas publicly objected to US participation in [[World War I]] and the collaboration of some anthropologists with US intelligence. In contrast, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the war effort in some form, including dozens who served in the [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the Office of War Information. In the 1950s, the [[American Anthropological Association]] provided the [[CIA]] information on the area specialities of its members, and a number of anthropologists participated in the U.S. government's [[Operation Camelot]] during the war in Vietnam. At the same time, many other anthropologists were active in the antiwar movement and passed resolutions in the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) condemning anthropological involvement in covert operations. Anthropologists were also vocal in their opposition to the war in Iraq, although there was no consensus amongst practitioners of the discipline.  

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The British Association for Social Anthropology has called certain scholarships ethically dangerous. For example, the British Association for Social Anthropology has condemned the [[CIA]]'s Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholars Program[http://avenue.org/ngic/about_prisp.htm], which funds anthropology students at US universities in preparation for them to spy for the [[United States]] government. The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that &quot;in relation with their own government and with host governments... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given.&quot;




Anthropology is the study of human diversity--diversity of body and behavior, in the past and present.  Anthropology consists of four subfields or subdisciplines:

'''Physical anthropology'''--studies the diversity of the human body in the past and present. It includes how we acquired the structure of our body over time, that is human evolution, as well as differences and relationships between human populations today and their adaptations to their local environments.  It also sometimes includes the evolution and diversity of our nearest relatives, the primates (apes and monkeys).

'''Cultural anthropology'''--studies the diversity of human behavior in the present.  This is what most anthropologists do and what most of the public sees when they look at &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine or the &quot;Discovery&quot; channel on TV.  Cultural anthropologists travel to foreign societies (although it is possible to do anthropology on your own society!), live among the people there, and try as much as they can to understand how those people live.

'''Archaeology'''--studies the diversity of human behavior in the past.  Since it studies how people lived in the past, these people are not available for us to visit and talk to...or at least, not people who are currently living in the same way that their ancestors did in the past.  Therefore, archaeologists must depend on the artifacts and features that the people produced in the past and attempt to reconstruct their vanished way of life from the remnants of their culture.

'''Linguistic anthropology'''--studies the diversity of human language in the past and present.  While language is naturally a part of culture, it is such a huge topic that anthropologists have separated it into its own area of study.  Linguistic anthropologists are concerned about the development of languages, perhaps even back to the first forms of language, and how language changes over time.  They are also interested in how different contemporary languages differ today, how they are related, and how we can learn about things like migration and diffusion from that data.  They also ask how language is related to and reflects on other aspects of culture.

Other sciences study humans too, of course.  History, economics, psychology, sociology, even biology and chemistry can study humans. How is anthropology different?

The answer is the anthropological perspective, that is, the way that anthropology approaches the subject and thinks about or studies humans and their behavior.  The anthropological perspective has three components:

(1) Cross-cultural or comparative--anthropology investigates humans in every form that they take.  We are interested to see the entire spectrum of human bodies and behaviors, trying to learn the range of humanity--all the ways that we can be human.  By seeing humans in their every manifestation, and comparing those manifestations to each other, we can ask what is possible for humans and what is necessary for humans.

(2) Holistic--anthropology tries to relate every part of culture to every other part.  It understands that the various parts of culture are connected to each other and that certain combinations tend to occur or not to occur (for example, there are no hunting and gathering cultures that traditionally lived in cities...that's just impossible!).  We are also interested in how a people's cultures is connected to their environment; again, without high technology, you are not going to see farming or cities in the middle of the desert or the arctic.

(3) Relativistic--this is the most profound yet controversial part of the anthropological perspective.  Relativism means that the rules or norms or values of a culture are relative to that specific culture.  In other words, say, monogamy may be normal or preferred in one culture, but polygamy may be normal or preferred in another.  The point is that different cultures believe different things or value different things or even mean different things with perhaps identical-looking behaviors or objects. 

When you go to another culture, or even just interact with another culture (for example, when you are doing international business), you cannot assume that other people understand things the same way you do.  In fact, you should assume that they don't! Anthropology counsels against hasty judgement of a new culture: aspects that a Western visitor may find strange or distasteful can be understood when situated within that culture's history and cosmology (understanding of the world). There will be a rationality for the phenomenon; it may be 'rational', however, according to a cultural logic that conflicts with Western understandings.  Malinowski's primacy of seeking to understand &quot;the native point of view&quot; remains fundamental to socio-cultural anthropology today.

The point is that, if we want to understand other people properly, we must see what their behaviors or words or concepts mean to them, not what they would mean to us. Meaning is relative to the culture that creates that meaning.  This is not to say that all things are true or even that all things are good - cultural relativism does not necessarily entail moral relativism. Indeed, the American Anthropological Association's qualified support (1948; 1997) for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as work by Sally Engle Merry, shows the latter is not a common anthropological point of view.

How does anthropology study culture?

One other way that anthropology is unique among the sciences that study humans is by its emphasis on 'fieldwork'  You cannot get to know another culture just by reading about it or watching movies about it.  At best, you could learn what other people have already discovered, but you could not learn anything new.  So anthropology requires actually going to that society and living within their culture as much as possible.  This is called [[Participant observation|participant observation]]. This depends crucially on finding (preferrably friendly) informants within the society, who will teach you their culture's rules of social behaviour, and include you in their activities.  Then, as much as possible, you will try to eat their food, speak their language, and live their lives, often actually residing with a family in that society.  It is not easy work, and it is not always fun, but there is no better way to learn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{portal}}'''Archaeology''' or '''archeology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''αρχαίος'' = ancient and ''λόγος'' = word/speech/discourse) is the study of [[Homo (genus)|human]] [[culture]]s through the recovery, documentation and analysis of material remains and environmental data, including [[architecture]], [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s, [[biofact]]s, human remains, and [[landscape]]s.

The goals of archaeology are to document and explain the origins and development of human [[culture]], understand [[culture history]], chronicle [[cultural evolution]], and study human [[behavior]] and [[ecology]], for both [[prehistory|prehistoric]] and [[history|historic]] societies.  It is considered to be one of the four sub-fields of [[anthropology]].

==Usage==
As with words such as [[encyclopedia]] and [[gynaecology]], archaeology traditionally has an ''ae'' combination; however, unlike other words, the ''ae'' is all but universally retained. Contrary to popular belief in other parts of the world, the spelling ''archeology'' is not predominant in [[United States]] [[dictionary|dictionaries]] and would look quite odd to most Americans. Like the claim that ''theater'' refers to a building and ''[[theatre]]'' refers to the [[performing arts]], the belief that ''archeology'' is an [[Americanism]] is little more than an [[urban myth]]. The traditional spelling, ''archaeology'', continues to be used in everyday writing throughout the world, including the U.S., even more so than theatre (the alternate spelling of which, while considered acceptable, is preferred less often than not).

==Ontology and definition==

In the [[Old World]], archaeology has tended to focus on the study of physical remains, the methods used in recovering them and the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings in achieving the subject's goals. The discipline's roots in [[antiquarian]]ism and the study of [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]] provided it with a natural affinity with the field of [[history]]. In the [[New World]], archaeology is more commonly devoted to the study of human [[society|societies]] and is treated as one of the four subfields of [[Anthropology]]. The other subfields of [[anthropology]] supplement the findings of archaeology in a holistic manner.  These subfields are [[cultural anthropology]], which studies behavioural, symbolic, and material dimensions of culture; [[linguistics]], which studies language, including the origins of language and language groups; and [[physical anthropology]], which includes the study of human evolution and physical and [[genetics|genetic]] characteristics. Other disciplines also supplement archaeology, such as [[paleontology]], [[paleozoology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[paleobotany]], [[geography]], [[geology]], [[art history]], and [[classics]].

Archaeology has been described as a [[craft]] that enlists the [[science|sciences]] to illuminate the [[humanities]]. Writing in 1948, the American archaeologist [[Walter Taylor]] asserted that &quot;Archaeology is neither history nor anthropology. As an autonomous discipline, it consists of a method and a set of specialised techniques for the gathering, or 'production' of cultural information&quot;.

Archaeology is an approach to understanding human culture through its material remains regardless of chronology. In [[England]], archaeologists have uncovered the long-lost layouts of medieval villages abandoned after the crises of the 14th century and the equally lost layouts of 17th century parterre gardens swept away by a change in fashion. In downtown [[New York City]] archaeologists have exhumed the 18th century remains of the Black burial ground.  Traditional Archaeology is viewed as the study of pre-historical human cultures; that is cultures that existed before the development of [[writing]] for that culture.  [[Historical archaeology]] is the study of post-[[writing]] cultures.

In the study of relatively recent cultures, which have been observed and studied by Western scholars, archaeology is closely allied with [[ethnography]]. This is the case in large parts of [[North America]], [[Oceania]], [[Siberia]], and other places where the study of archaeology mingles with the living traditions of the cultures being studied. [[Kennewick Man]] is an example of archaeology interacting with modern culture.  In the study of cultures that were literate or had literate neighbours, [[history]] and archaeology supplement one another for broader understanding of the complete cultural context, as at [[Hadrian's Wall]].

==Importance and applicability==

Most of human history is not described by any written records. [[Writing]] did not exist anywhere in the world until about 5000 years ago, and only spread among a relatively small number of technologically advanced [[civilisation]]s. In contrast [[Homo Sapiens|''Homo sapiens'']] have existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of [[Homo (genus)|''Homo'']] for millions of years (see [[Human evolution]]).  These civilisations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they have been open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a civilisation that is literate at some levels, many important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the formative early years of human civilisation - the development of [[agriculture]], cult practices of [[folk religion]], the rise of the first [[city|cities]] - must come from archaeology.

Even where written records do exist, they are invariably incomplete or biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the [[elite]] classes, such as the [[clergy]] or the [[bureaucracy]] of court or temple. The literacy even of an [[aristocracy]] has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the rest of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into [[library|libraries]] and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases of the literate classes, and cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record is nearer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own inaccuracies, such as [[sampling bias]] and [[differential preservation]].

In addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong [[aesthetic]] appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies. 

This view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', ''[[The Mummy (1999 movie)|The Mummy]]'', and ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]''. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of [[pseudoscience]] are invariably levelled at their proponents (see Pseudoarchaeology, below). However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of the modern state of archaeology.

==Goals==

There is still a tremendous emphasis in the practice of archaeology on field techniques and methodologies. These include the tasks of surveying areas in order to find new sites, digging sites in order to unearth the cultural remains therein, and classification and preservation techniques in order to analyse and keep these remains. Every phase of this process can be a source of information.

The goals of archaeology are not always the same. There are at least three broad, distinct theories of exactly what archaeological research should do. (These are beyond the scope of the present discussion, and are discussed at length below.) Nevertheless, there is much common ground.

===Academic sub-disciplines===

''Main article: [[Archaeological sub-disciplines]]''

As with most [[academia|academic]] disciplines, there are a very large number of [[archaeological sub-disciplines]] characterised by a specific method or type of material (e.g. [[lithic analysis]], [[music (archaeology)|music]], [[archaeobotany]]), geographical or chronological focus (e.g. [[Near Eastern archaeology]], [[Medieval archaeology]]), other thematic concern (e.g. [[landscape archaeology]]), or a specific [[archaeological culture]] or [[civilisation]] (e.g. [[Egyptology]]).

===Cultural resources management===
''[[Cultural resources management]]'' (CRM) (also called ''heritage management'' in Britain) is a branch of archaeology that accounts for most research done in the [[United States]] and much of that in [[western Europe]] as well. In the United States, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] of 1966 and most of the archaeology done in that country today proceeds from either direct or related requirements of that measure. In the United States, the vast majority of taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped to preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, this mandates that no construction project on [[public land]] or involving public funds may damage an unstudied [[archaeological site]]. 

The application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990 [[PPG 16]] has required planners to consider archaeology as a [[material consideration]] in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organisations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the developer's expense.

Among the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of [[cultural]] sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavation indicates the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely. CRM is a thriving entity, especially in the United States and Europe where archaeologists from private companies and all levels of government engage in the practice of their discipline.

Cultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour.

==Field methods==
===Survey===
A modern archaeological project often begins with a [[archaeological survey|survey]]. ''Regional survey'' is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. ''Site survey'' is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and [[midden|middens]], within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.

Survey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible features there. [[Gordon Willey]] pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the [[Viru Valley]] of coastal [[Peru]], and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.

Survey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artefacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods.) It avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as [[settlement pattern|settlement patterns]] and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into [[map|maps]], which may show surface features and/or artefact distribution.

The simplest survey technique is ''surface survey''. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanised transport, to search for features or artefacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as [[auger|augers]], [[corer|corers]], and [[shovel test]] pits.

''[[Aerial survey]]'' is conducted using [[camera|cameras]] attached to [[aircraft]], [[balloon|balloons]], or even [[kite|kites]]. A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. [[Plant|Plants]] growing above a stone structure, such as a wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as [[midden|middens]]) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening [[cereal|grain]], which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial survey also employs [[infrared]], ground-penetrating [[radar]] wavelengths, and [[thermography]].

''[[Geophysical survey]]'' is the most effective way to see beneath the ground. [[Magnetometer|Magnetometers]] detect minute deviations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] caused by [[iron]] artefacts, [[kiln|kilns]], some types of [[stone structures]], and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the [[electrical resistivity]] of the soil are also widely used. Most soils are [[moisture|moist]] below the surface, which gives them a relatively low resistivity. Features such as hard-packed floors or concentrations of stone have a higher resistivity. 

Although some archaeologists consider the use of [[metal detector|metal detectors]] to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying. Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on [[English Civil War]] battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a nineteenth century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to the archaeological record where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context.  In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]].

Regional survey in maritime archaeology uses [[side-scan sonar]].

===Excavation===
[[Excavation|Archaeological excavation]] existed even when the field was still the domain of amateurs, and it remains the source of the majority of data recovered in most field projects. It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as stratigraphy, three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.

Modern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their [[provenance]] or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see [[Primary Laws of Archaeology]]). Similarly, their [[archaeological association|association]], or relationship with nearby objects and features, needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce what artefacts and features were likely used together and which may be from different phases of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its [[stratigraphy]]; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct [[culture|cultures]], artefacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.

Excavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research. Also, as a destructive process, it carries [[ethics|ethical]] concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is even more important in excavation than in survey. It is common for large mechanical equipment, such as [[backhoe]]s ([[J. C. Bamford|JCBs]]), to be used in excavation, especially to remove the [[topsoil]] ([[overburden]]), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with trowels or hoes to ensure that all features are apparent.

The next task is to form a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the natural [[subsoil]] are normally excavated in portions in order to produce a visible [[archaeological section]] for recording. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and recording sheets are filled in describing the [[context]] of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.

==Post-excavation analysis==
Once artefacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them, to gain as much data as possible. This process is known as post-excavation analysis, and is normally the most time-consuming part of the archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for the final excavation reports on major sites to take years to be published.

At its most basic, the artefacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections, in order to classify them [[typology|typologically]] and to identify other sites with similar artefact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through [[archaeological science]], meaning that artefacts can be dated and their compositions examined. The bones, plants and pollen collected from a site can all be analysed (using the techniques of [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], and [[palynology]]), while any texts can usually be [[Decipherment|deciphered]].

These techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known and therefore contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.

==History of archaeology==
''Main article: [[History of archaeology]]''

The history of archaeology has been one of increasing professionalisation, and the use of an increasing range of techniques, to obtain as much data on the site being examined as possible.

Excavations of ancient monuments and the collection of antiquities have been taking place for thousands of years, but these were mostly for the extraction of valuable or aesthetically pleasing artefacts.

It was only in the 19th century that the systematic study of the past through its physical remains began to be carried out. Archaeological methods were developed by both interested amateurs and professionals, including [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]] and [[William Flinders Petrie]].

This process was continued in the 20th century by such people as [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation greatly improved the quality of evidence that could be obtained.

During the 20th century, the development of [[urban archaeology]] and then [[rescue archaeology]] have been important factors, as has the development of [[archaeological science]], which has greatly increased the amount of data that it is possible to obtain.

==Archaeological theory==
''Main article: [[Archaeological theory]]''

There is no single theory of archaeology, and even definitions are disputed. Until the mid-20th century and the introduction of technology, there was a general consensus that archaeology was closely related to both history and anthropology. The first major phase in the history of archaeological theory is commonly referred to as '''[[Cultural-history archaeology|cultural, or culture, history]]''', which was developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In the 1960s, a number of young, primarily American archaeologists, such as [[Lewis Binford]], rebelled against the paradigms of cultural history. They proposed a &quot;New Archaeology&quot;, which would be more &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;anthropological&quot;, with [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]] very important parts of what became known as '''[[processual archaeology]]'''.

In the 1980s, a new movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]], [[Christopher Tilley]], [[Daniel Miller]], and [[Ian Hodder]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to science and impartiality and emphasised the importance of relativism, becoming known as '''[[post-processual archaeology]]'''. However, this approach has been criticised by processualists as lacking scientific rigour. The validity of both processualism and post-procuessualism is still under debate.

Archaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including [[evolution|neo-Darwinian evolutionary thought]], [[phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[Functionalism (sociology)|Functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[Feminist archaeology]], and [[Systems theory in archaeology|Systems theory]].

==Public archaeology==
Early archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities. Such pursuits continue to fascinate the public, portrayed in books (such as ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'') and films (such as ''[[The Mummy (1999 movie)|The Mummy]]'' and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'').

Much thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as [[Copán]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]], but the stuff of modern archaeology is not so reliably sensational. In addition, archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in modern [[archaeological survey|survey]], [[excavation]], and [[archaeological data processing|data processing]] techniques. Some archaeologists refer to such portrayals as &quot;[[pseudoarchaeology]]&quot;.

Nevertheless, archaeology has profited from its portrayal in the mainstream media. Many practitioners point to the childhood excitement of [[Indiana Jones]] films and [[Tomb Raider games]] as the inspiration for them to enter the field. Archaeologists are also very much reliant on public support, the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed. Without a strong public interest in the subject, often sparked by significant finds and celebrity archaeologists, it would be a great deal harder for archaeologists to gain the political and financial support they require.

In the UK, popular archaeology programmes such as ''[[Time Team]]'' and ''[[Meet the Ancestors]]'' have resulted in a huge upsurge in public interest.  Where possible, archaeologists now make more provision for public involvement and outreach in larger projects than they once did. However, the move towards being more professional has meant that volunteer places are now relegated to unskilled labour, and even this is less freely available than before. Developer-funded excavation necessitates a well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately, observing the necessary [[health and safety]] and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern [[construction|building site]] with tight deadlines. Certain charities and [[local government]] bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project. There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial [[training excavations]] and archaeological holiday tours.

Archaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies. Anyone looking to get involved in the field without having to pay to do so should contact a local group.

===Pseudoarchaeology===
''Main article: [[Pseudoarchaeology]]''.

Pseudoarchaeology is an umbrella term for all activities that claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of [[processual archaeology]], or the specific critiques of it contained in  [[Post-processual archaeology|Post-processualism]].

An example of this type is the writing of [[Erich von Däniken]]. His ''[[Chariots of the Gods]]'' (1968), together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilisation on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilisations. This theory, known as [[palaeocontact theory]], is not exclusively Däniken's nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.

===Looting===
Looting of archaeological sites by people in search of [[hoard|hoards]] of buried treasure is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian [[pharaoh|pharaohs]] were looted in antiquity. The advent of archaeology has made ancient sites objects of great scientific and public interest, but it has also attracted unwelcome attention to the works of past peoples. A brisk commercial demand for artefacts encourages looting and the [[illicit antiquities]] trade, which smuggles items abroad to private collectors. Looters damage the integrity of a historic site, deny archaeologists valuable information that would be learnt from excavation, and are often deemed to be robbing local people of their heritage. 

The popular consciousness often associates looting with poor [[Third World]] countries. Many are former homes to many well-known ancient civilizations but lack the financial resources or political will to protect even the most significant sites. Certainly, the high prices that intact objects can command relative to a poor farmer's income make looting a tempting financial proposition for some local people. However, looting has taken its toll in places as rich and populous as the United States and Western Europe as well. Abandoned towns of the ancient [[Sinagua]] people of [[Arizona]], clearly visible in the desert landscape, have been destroyed in large numbers by treasure hunters. Sites in more densely populated areas farther east have also been looted. Where looting is proscribed by law it takes place under cover of night, with the [[metal detector]] a common instrument used to identify profitable places to dig.

===Public outreach===
Motivated by a desire to halt '''looting''', curb '''pseudoarchaeology''', and to secure greater public funding and appreciation for their work, archaeologists are mounting '''public-outreach campaigns'''. They seek to stop looting by informing prospective artefact collectors of the provenance of these goods, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting and the danger that it poses to science and their own heritage. Common methods of public outreach include press releases and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation.

The final audience for archaeologists' work is the public and it is increasingly realised that their work is ultimately being done to benefit and inform them. The putative social benefits of local heritage awareness are also being promoted with initiatives to increase civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects and better interpretation and presentation of existing sites.

===Descendant peoples===
In the United States, examples such as the case of [[Kennewick Man]] have illustrated the tensions between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s and archaeologists which can be summarised as a conflict between a need to remain respectful towards burials sacred sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artefacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present. To an archaeologist, the past is long-gone and must be reconstructed through its material remains; to indigenous peoples, it is often still alive.

As a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of postprocessualism, some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of [[indigenous peoples]] likely to be descended from those under study.

Archaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites in order to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.

While this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.

====Repatriation====
A new trend in the heated controversy between [[First Nations]] groups and scientists is the [[repatriation]] of native [[artifacts]] to the original descendants. An example of this occurred June 21, 2005, when a community members and elders from a number of the 10 [[Algonquian]] nations in the [[Ottawa]] area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation in [[Kanawagi, Quebec]], to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods — some dating back 6,000 years. 

The ceremony marked the end of a journey spanning thousands of years and many miles. The remains and artifacts, including [[beads]], [[tools]] and [[weapons]], were originally excavated from various sites in the [[Ottawa Valley]], including [[Morrison]] and the [[Allumette Islands]]. They had been part of the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]’s research collection for decades, some since the late 1800s. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional [[redcedar]] and [[birchbark]] boxes lined with redcedar chips, [[muskrat]] and [[beaver pelts]]. 

Now, an inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 90 boxes of various sizes are buried. Although negotiations were at times tense between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach agreement (source: [http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/SO05/indepth/archaeology.asp Canadian Geographic Online]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Agricultural science''' is a broad multidisciplinary field that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic, and [[social sciences]] that are used in the practice and understanding of [[agriculture]]. ([[veterinary medicine|Veterinary science]], but not [[animal science]], is often excluded from the definition.)

==Agriculture and agricultural science ==

The two terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:

:Agriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.

:Agronomy is [[research and development]] related to studying and improving plant-based agriculture.

Agricultural sciences include research and development on:

* Production techniques (e.g., [[irrigation]] management, recommended [[nitrogen]] inputs)
* Improving [[agricultural productivity|production]] in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of [[drought]]-resistant crops and animals, development of new [[pesticide]]s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro [[cell culture]] techniques)
* Transformation of primary products into end-[[consumer]] products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of [[dairy product]]s)
* Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., [[soils retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], [[waste management]], [[bioremediation]])
* [[Theoretical production ecology]], relating to crop production modeling
* [[traditional agricultural systems]] such as which serve to feed most people in the world and which often retain integration with nature in a way that hs proven more sustainable than modern systems
* Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers of China and India.

== Agricultural science: a local science ==

With the exception of [[theoretical production ecology|theoretical agronomy]], research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of [[ecoregions]], because it is closely linked to soil properties and [[climate]], which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, [[soil]] characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interation with nature.

== History of agricultural science ==
''Main Article: [[History of agricultural science]]''

Agricultural science is seen by some to have began with [[Mendel]]'s insightful genetc work, but in modern terms might be better dated from the [[chemical fertilizer]] outputs of [[plant physiological]] understanding in eighteenth century [[Germany]]. Today it is very different from what it was even in 1950. Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and [[developing countries]], often referred to as the [[Green Revolution]], was closely tied to progress made in  selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide|phytosanitary product]]s.

As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact  of agriculture in general and more recently [[intensive agriculture]], industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include technological fields  that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as [[integrated pest management]], [[waste management|waste treatment]] technologies, [[landscape architecture]], [[genomics]], and [[agricultural philosophy]] fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from non-essential eeconomic 'goods'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.

New technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]]. Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of [[traditional agriculture]], including interaction of [[religion and agriculture]], and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.

== Agricultural science and agriculture crisis==

Agriculture sciences seek to feed the world's population while preventing [[biosafety]] problems that may affect human health and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. This requires promoting good management of [[natural resources]] and respect for the environment, and increasingly concern for the psychological wellbeing of all concerned in the food production and consumption system.

Economic, environmental, and social aspects of agriculture sciences are subjects of ongoing debate. Recent crises (such as Avian Flu, [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy|mad cow disease]] and issues such as the use of [[genetically modified organism]]s) illustrate the complexity and importance of this debate.

[[Image:Alchemist's Laboratory, Heinrich Khunrath, Amphitheatrum sapientiae aeternae, 1595 c.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Alchemist's laboratory, by Hans Vredman de Vries, c 1595.]]

'''Alchemy''' is an early [[protoscience|protoscientific]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] discipline combining elements of [[chemistry]], [[metallurgy]], [[physics]], [[medicine]], [[astrology]], [[semiotics]], [[mysticism]], [[spiritualism]], and [[art]]. Alchemy has been practiced in ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[India]], and [[China]], in [[Classical Antiquity|Classical]] [[Greece]] and [[Rome]], in the [[Caliphate|Islamic empire]], and then in [[Europe]] up to the 19th century &amp;mdash; in a complex network of schools and philosophical systems spanning at least 2500 years.

Western alchemy has always been closely connected with [[Hermeticism]], a philosophical and spiritual system that traces its roots to [[Hermes Trismegistus]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] Egyptian-Greek deity and legendary alchemist. These two disciplines influenced the birth of [[Rosicrucianism]], an important esoteric movement of the 17th century. In the 19th century, as mainstream alchemy evolved into modern chemistry, its mystic and Hermetic aspects became the focus of a modern [[spiritual alchemy]], where material manipulations are viewed as mere symbols of spiritual transformations.  

The alchemists did not follow what is now known as the [[scientific method]], and much of the &quot;knowledge&quot; they produced was later found to be banal, limited, wrong, or meaningless. Today, the discipline is of interest mainly to [[history of science|historians of science]] and [[history of philosophy|philosophy]], and for its mystic, [[esoterism|esoteric]], and artistic aspects.  Nevertheless, alchemy was one of the main precursors of modern [[science]]s, and we owe to the ancient alchemists the discovery of many substances and processes that are the mainstay of modern chemical and metallurgical industries.  

==Overview==
[[Image:William Fettes Douglas - The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The alchemist - by Sir [[William Fettes Douglas]].]]

=== Alchemy as a proto-science ===
The common perception of alchemists is that they were [[pseudoscience|pseudo-scientists]], [[crackpot]]s and [[charlatans]], who attempted to turn [[lead]] into [[gold]], believed that the universe was composed of the [[classical element|four elements]] of earth, air, fire, and water, and spent most of their time concocting miraculous [[medication|remedies]], [[poison]]s, and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] [[potion]]s. 

This picture is rather unfair.  Although many alchemists were indeed crackpots and charlatans, many were well-meaning and intelligent scholars, who were simply struggling to make sense of a subject which, as we now know, was far beyond the reach of their tools.  These people were basically &quot;proto-scientists&quot;, who attempted to explore and investigate the nature of chemical substances and processes. They had to rely on unsystematic experimentation, traditional know-how, [[rule of thumb|rules of thumb]], &amp;mdash; and plenty of speculative thought to fill in the wide gaps in existing knowledge. 

Given these conditions, the mystic character of alchemy is quite understandable: to the early alchemist, chemical transformations could only seem like magical phenomena governed by incomprehensible laws, whose potential and limitations he had no way of knowing. Having discovered that a specific procedure could turn an earth-like ore into glistening metal, it was only natural to speculate that some different procedure could turn a metal into another.

At the same time, it was clear to the alchemists that &quot;something&quot; was generally being conserved in chemical processes, even in the most dramatic changes of physical state and appearance; i.e. that substances contained some &quot;principles&quot; that could be hidden under many outer forms, and revealed by proper manipulation.  Throughout the history of the discipline, alchemists struggled very hard to understand the nature of these principles, and find some order and sense in the results of their chemical experiments &amp;mdash; which were often undermined by impure or poorly characterized reagents, the lack of quantitative measurements, and confusing and inconsistent nomenclature.

In spite of those difficulties, and of many false turns and loops, the alchemists managed to make steady progress in the understanding of the natural world. To them we owe the discovery of many important substances and chemical processes, which paved the way for the modern science of chemistry, and are still the mainstay of  today's chemical and metallurgical industries.

=== Alchemy as a philosophical and spiritual discipline ===
The best known goals of the [[alchemist]]s were the [[transmutation]] of common metals into [[gold]] or [[silver]], and the creation of a &quot;[[universal panacea|panacea]]&quot;, a remedy that supposedly would cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely. Starting with the Middle Ages, European alchemists invested much effort on the search for the  &quot;[[philosopher's stone]]&quot;, a mythical substance that was believed to be an essential ingredient for either or both of those goals. Alchemists enjoyed prestige and support through the centuries, though not for their pursuit of those unattainable goals, nor the mystic and philosophical speculation that dominates their literature. Rather it was for their mundane contributions to the &quot;chemical&quot; industries of the day &amp;mdash; ore testing and refining, metalworking, production of ink, dyes, paints, and cosmetics, leather tanning, ceramics and glass manufacture, preparation of extracts and liquors, and so on. (It seems that the preparation of ''[[aqua vitae]]'', the &quot;water of life&quot;, was a fairly popular &quot;experiment&quot; among European alchemists.) 

On the other hand, alchemists never had the intellectual tools nor the motivation to separate the physical (chemical) aspects of their craft from the metaphysical interpretations. Indeed, from antiquity until well into the [[Modern Age]], a physics devoid of metaphysical insight would have been as unsatisfying as a metaphysics devoid of physical manifestation. For one thing, the lack of common words for chemical concepts and processes, as well as the need for secrecy, led alchemists to borrow the terms and symbols of [[Bible|biblical]] and [[Paganism|pagan]] [[mythology]], [[astrology]], [[kabbalah]], and other mystic and [[esoterism|esoteric]] fields; so that even the plainest chemical recipe ended up reading like an abstruse magic incantation.  Moreover, alchemists sought in those fields the theoretical frameworks into which they could fit their growing collection of disjointed experimental facts.

Starting with the middle ages, some alchemists increasingly came to view these metaphysical aspects as the true foundation of alchemy; and chemical substances, physical states, and material processes as mere metaphors for spiritual entities, states and transformations. Thus, both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible and ephemeral state towards a perfect, healthy, incorruptible and everlasting state; and the philosopher's stone then represented some mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented some hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic [[alchemical symbol]]s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laborously &quot;decoded&quot; in order to discover their true meaning.

Some humanistic scholars now see these spiritual and metaphysical allegories as the truest and most valuable aspect of alchemy, and even claim that the development of chemistry out of alchemy was a &quot;corruption&quot; of the original Hermetic tradition. This is the view espoused by contemporary practitioners of [[spiritual alchemy]]. Most scientists, on the other hand, tend to take quite the opposite view: to them, the path from the material side of alchemy to modern chemistry was the &quot;straight road&quot; in the evolution of the discipline, while the  metaphysically oriented brand of alchemy was a &quot;wrong turn&quot; that led to nowhere. In either view, however, the naïve interpretations of some practitoners or the fraudulent hopes fostered by others should not diminish the contribution of the more sincere alchemists.

===Alchemy and astrology===
Since its earliest times, alchemy has been closely connected to [[astrology]] &amp;mdash; which, in Islam and Europe, generally meant the traditional [[Babylon]]ian-Greek school of astrology. Alchemical systems often postulated that each of the seven [[planet]]s known to the ancients &quot;[[astrological sign|ruled]]&quot; or was associated with a certain [[metal]]. See the separate article on [[astrology and alchemy]] for further details.

===Alchemy in the age of science===
Up to the 18th century, alchemy was actually considered serious science in Europe; for instance, [[Isaac Newton]] devoted considerably more of his time and writing to the study of alchemy than he did to either optics or physics, for which he is famous, (see [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]]). Other eminent alchemists of the Western world are [[Roger Bacon]], Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Thomas Browne]], and [[Parmigianino]]. The decline of alchemy began in the 18th century with the birth of modern chemistry, which provided a more precise and reliable framework for matter transmutations and medicine, within a new grand design of the universe based on rational materialism.  

In the first half of the nineteenth century, one established chemist, Baron [[Carl Reichenbach]], researched on concepts similar to the old alchemy, such as the [[Odic force]], but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.

Matter transmutation, the old goal of alchemy, enjoyed a moment in the sun in the 20th century when physicists were able to convert lead atoms into gold atoms via a [[nuclear reaction]]. However, the new gold atoms, being unstable [[isotope]]s, lasted for under five seconds before they broke apart.  More recently, reports of table-top element transmutation — by means of [[electrolysis]] or [[sonic cavitation]] — were the pivot of the [[cold fusion]] controversy of 1989. None of those claims have yet been reliably duplicated.

Alchemical symbolism has been occasionally used in the 20th century by [[psychology|psychologists]] and philosophers. [[Carl Jung]] reexamined alchemical symbolism and theory and began to show the inner meaning of alchemical work as a [[spirituality|spiritual]] path. Alchemical philosophy, symbols and methods have enjoyed something of a renaissance in [[post-modernism|post-modern]] contexts, such as the [[New Age]] movement. Even some physicists have played with alchemical ideas in books such as ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' and ''[[The Dancing Wu Li Masters]]''.

===Alchemy as a subject of historical research ===
The history of alchemy has become a vigorous academic field. As the obscure&amp;mdash;''hermetic'', of course&amp;mdash;language of the alchemists is gradually being &quot;deciphered&quot;, historians are becoming more  aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, [[kabbala|kabbalism]], [[spiritualism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and other mystic movements, [[cryptography]], [[witchcraft]]&amp;mdash;and, of course, the evolution of [[science]] and [[philosophy]].

==Etymology==
{{Wiktionarypar|alchemy}}
The word ''alchemy'' comes from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''al-k&amp;#299;miya&amp;#704;'' or ''al-kh&amp;#299;miya&amp;#704;'' (&amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1603;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1569; or &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1582;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1569;), which might be formed from the article ''al-'' and the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''chumeia''  (&amp;chi;η&amp;mu;&amp;epsilon;&amp;#943;&amp;alpha;) meaning &quot;cast together&quot;, &quot;pour together&quot;, &quot;weld&quot;, &quot;alloy&quot;, etc. (from ''khumatos'', &quot;that which is poured out, an ingot&quot;, or from Persian ''Kimia'' meaning &quot;gold.&quot; A decree of [[Diocletian]], written about 300 CE in Greek, speaks against &quot;the ancient writings of the Egyptians, which treat of the ''kh&amp;#275;mia'' [transmutation] of gold and silver&quot;. 

It has been suggested that the Arabic word ''al-k&amp;#299;miya&amp;#704;'' actually means &quot;the Egyptian [science]&quot;, borrowing from the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] word for &quot;Egypt&quot;, ''k&amp;#275;me'' (or its equivalent in the Mediaeval [[Bohairic]] dialect of Coptic, ''kh&amp;#275;me''). The Coptic word derives from [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] ''km&amp;#7881;'', itself from ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''kmt''. The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour &quot;black&quot; (Egypt was the &quot;Black Land&quot;, by contrast with the &quot;Red Land&quot;, the surrounding desert); so this etymology could also explain the nickname &quot;Egyptian black arts&quot;. However, this theory may be just an example of [[folk etymology]].

==History==
[[Image:Alchemy-Digby-RareSecrets.png|thumb|right|300px|Extract and symbol key from a 17th century book on alchemy. The symbols used have a one-to-one correspondence with symbols used in [[astrology]] at the time.]]
Alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents.  These traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and &quot;genetic&quot; relationships. 

One can distinguish at least two major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: [[Chinese alchemy]], centered in [[China]] and its zone of cultural influence; and [[Western alchemy]], whose center has shifted over the millennia between [[Egypt]], [[Greece]] and [[Rome]], the [[Islam]]ic world, and finally back to [[Europe]]. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoism]], whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system, with only superficial connections to the major Western religions.  It is still an open question whether these two strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.

===Alchemy in Ancient Egypt===
The origin of western alchemy may generally be traced to [[Ancient Egypt|ancient (pharaonic) Egypt]].  [[Metallurgy]] and [[mysticism]] were inexorably tied together in the ancient world, as the transformation of drab ore into shining metal must have seemed to be an act of magic governed by mysterious rules. It is claimed therefore that Alchemy in ancient Egypt was the domain of the priestly class.  

Egyptian alchemy is known mostly through the writings of ancient (Hellenic) [[Greece|Greek]] philosophers, which in turn have often survived only in Islamic translations. Practically no original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived. Those writings, if they existed, were likely lost when the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Diocletian]] ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria (292), which had been a center of Egyptian alchemy.

Nevertheless [[archaeological]] expeditions in recent times have unearthed evidence of chemical analysis during the [[Naqada]] periods. For example, a [[copper]] tool dating to the [[Naqada]] era bears evidence of having been used in such a way (reference: artifact 5437 on display at [http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/naqada/tombs/finds7.html]). Also, the process of [[tanning]] [[animal]] [[Rawhide|skins]] was already known in [[Predynastic Egypt]] as early as the [[6th millennium BC]] [http://www.touregypt.net/ebph5.htm]; although it possibly was discovered haphazardly.

Other evidence indicates early alchemists in [[Ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]] had invented [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] by [[4000 BC]] and [[glass]] by [[1500 BC]]. The chemical reaction involved in the production of [[Calcium Oxide]] is one of the oldest known (references: [[Calcium Oxide]], [[limekiln]]):

:CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + heat → CaO + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Ancient Egypt]] additionally produced [[cosmetics]], [[cement]], [[faience]] and also [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] for [[shipbuilding]]. [[Papyrus]] had also been invented by [[3000 BC]].

Legend has it that the founder of Egyptian alchemy was the [[deity|god]] [[Thoth]], called Hermes-Thoth or Thrice-Great Hermes (''[[Hermes Trismegistus]]'') by the Greek. According to legend, he wrote what were called the forty-two Books of Knowledge, covering all fields of knowledge—including alchemy. Hermes's symbol was the [[caduceus]] or serpent-staff, which became one of many of alchemy's principal symbols. The &quot;[[Emerald Tablet]]&quot; or ''[[Hermetica]]'' of Thrice-Great Hermes, which is known only through Greek and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translations, is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the [[hermeticism|hermetic philosophy]] by its early practitioners.

The first point of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; tells the purpose of hermetical science: &quot;in truth certainly and without doubt, whatever is below is like that which is above, and whatever is above is like that which is below, to accomplish the miracles of one thing.&quot; {{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burckhardt, p. 196-7|a}} This is the [[macrocosm]]-[[microcosm]] belief central to the hermetic philosophy.  In other words, the human body (the microcosm) is affected by the exterior world (the macrocosm), which includes the heavens through [[astrology]], and the earth through the [[classical element|element]]s. {{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burckhardt,p. 34-42|b}}

It has been speculated that a riddle from the Emerald Tablet—&quot;it was carried in the womb by the wind&quot;—refers to the distillation of oxygen from [[sodium nitrate|saltpeter]]—a process that was unknown in Europe until its (re)discovery by Sendivogius in the 17th century.

In the 4th century BC, the Greek-speaking [[Macedon|Macedonia]]ns conquered Egypt and founded the city of Alexandria in 332.  This brought them into contact with Egyptian ideas. See [[#Alchemy in the Greek world|Alchemy in the Greek World]] below.

===Chinese alchemy===
Whereas Western alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble ones, Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine.  The [[philosopher's stone]] of European alchemists can be compared to the [[Elixir of life|Grand Elixir of Immortality]] sought by Chinese alchemists. However, in the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher's stone was often equated with the [[universal panacea]]; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than it initially appears.

[[Black powder]] may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists. Described in 9th century texts and used in [[fireworks]] by the 10th Century, it was used in [[cannon]]s by 1290. From China, the use of gunpowder spread to [[Japan]], the [[Mongol]]s, the Arab world and Europe. Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in 1241, and in Europe starting with the 14th century.

Black powder was most likely invented in the middle east before it found its way
to China. Saltpeter, the critical oxidising component, was found naturally in India and
along the Salt trade routes in the Middle East.

Chinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoist forms of [[traditional Chinese medicine|medicine]], such as [[Acupuncture]] and [[Moxibustion]], and to [[martial arts]] such as [[Tai Chi Chuan]] and [[Kung Fu]] (although some Tai Chi schools believe that their art derives from the Hygienic or Philosophical branches of Taoism, not the Alchemical).

===Indian alchemy===
Little is known in the West about the character and history of [[India]]n alchemy. An 11th century [[Iran|Persia]]n alchemist named [[al-Biruni]] reported that they &quot;have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them, which is called [[Rasavātam]]. It means the art which is restricted to certain operations, drugs, compounds, and medicines, most of which are taken from plants. Its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age.&quot;  The best example of a text based on this science is ''The Vaishashik Darshana'' of [[Kanad]]a (fl. 600 BC), who described an atomic theory over a century before Democritus.

The texts of [[Ayurvedic]] Medicine and Science have aspects related to alchemy, such having cures for all known diseases. The similarities in [[Ayurveda]] and alchemy are that both had methods used to treat people by putting oils over them.

Some people have also noted certain similarities between the [[metaphysics]] of the [[Samkhya]] philosophical tradition of Hinduism and the metaphysics of alchemy. Whether there is any direct connection between the two systems is an open question.

The Rasavadam was understood by very few people at the time. Two famous examples were Nagarjunacharya and Nityanadhiya. Nagarjunacharya was a buddhist monk who, in ancient times, ran the great university of Nagarjuna Sagar. His famous book, Rasaratanakaram, is a famous example of early Indian medicine. 
In traditional Indian medicinal terminology 'rasa' translates as 'mercury' and Nagarjunacharya was said to have developed a method to convert the mercury into gold. Much of his original writings are lost to us, but his teachings still have strong influence on traditional Indian medicine (Ayureveda) to this day.

===Alchemy in the Greek world===
The Greek city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt was a center of Greek alchemical knowledge, and retained its preeminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods. The Greeks appropriated the hermetical beliefs of the Egyptians and melded with them the philosophies of [[Pythagoras|Pythagoreanism]], [[ionianism]], and [[gnosticism]]. Pythagorean philosophy is, essentially, the belief that numbers rule the universe, originating from the observations of sound, stars, and geometric shapes like triangles, or anything from which a [[ratio]] could be derived. [[Ionia]]n thought was based on the belief that the universe could be explained through concentration on [[phenomenon|natural phenomena]]; this philosophy is believed to have originated with [[Thales]] and his pupil [[Anaximander]], and later developed by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], whose works came to be an integral part of alchemy.  According to this belief, the universe can be described by a few unified [[law (principle)|natural laws]] that can be determined only through careful, thorough, and exacting philosophical explorations. The third component introduced to hermetical philosophy by the Greeks was [[gnosticism]], a belief prevalent in the Christian and early post-Christian [[Roman empire]], that the world is imperfect because it was created in a flawed manner, and that learning about the nature of spiritual matter would lead to salvation.  They further believed that [[god (monotheism)|God]] did not &quot;create&quot; the universe in the classic sense, but that the universe was created &quot;from&quot; him, but was corrupted in the process (rather than becoming corrupted by the transgressions of Adam and Eve, i.e. [[original sin]]).  According to Gnostic belief, by worshipping the cosmos, nature, or the creatures of the world, one worships the True God.  Gnostics do not seek salvation from sin, but instead seek to escape ignorance, believing that sin is merely a consequence of ignorance. Platonic and neo-Platonic theories about universals and the omnipotence of God were also absorbed.

One very important concept introduced at this time, originated by [[Empedocles]] and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: ''earth'', ''air'', ''water'', and ''fire''. According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed. {{ref_harvard|Lindsay|Lindsay, p. 16|a}}  

The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are. &quot;...True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word. The four elements are simply the primary, and most general, qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form.&quot; {{ref_harvard|Hitchcock|Hitchcock, p. 66|a}} Later alchemists (if Plato and Aristotle can be called alchemists) extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept.

===Alchemy in the Roman Empire===
The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] adopted Greek alchemy and metaphysics, just as they adopted much of Greek knowledge and philosophy. By the end of the [[Roman empire]] the Greek alchemical philosophy had been joined to the philosophies of the Egyptians to create the cult of Hermeticism. {{ref_harvard|Lindsay|Lindsay|b}}

However, the development of [[Christianity]] in the Empire brought a contrary line of thinking, stemming from [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354-430 AD), an early Christian philosopher who wrote of his beliefs shortly before the [[fall of the Roman Empire]]. In essence, he felt that [[reason]] and [[faith]] could be used to understand God, but [[experimental philosophy]] was evil: &quot;There is also present in the soul, by means of these same bodily sense, a kind of empty longing and curiosity which aims not at taking pleasure in the flesh but at acquiring experience through the flesh, and this empty curiosity he is dignified by the names of learning and science.&quot; {{ref_harvard|Augustine|Augustine, p. 245|a}}

Augustinian ideas were decidedly anti-experimental, yet when Aristotelian experimental techniques were made available to the West they were not shunned.  Still, Augustinian thought was well ingrained in [[medieval society]] and was used to show alchemy as being un-Godly.

Much of the Roman knowledge of Alchemy, like that of the Greeks and Egyptians, is now lost. In Alexandria, the centre of alchemical studies in the Roman Empire, the art was mainly oral and in the interests of secrecy little was committed to paper. (Whence the use of &quot;hermetic&quot; to mean &quot;secretive&quot;.) {{ref_harvard|Lindsay|Lindsay, p. 155|c}} It is possible that some writing was done in Alexandria, and that it was subsequently lost or destroyed in fires and the turbulent periods that followed.

===Alchemy in the Islamic world===
After the fall of the Roman Empire, the focus of alchemical development moved to the Middle East. Much more is known about [[Islam]]ic alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Islamic translations. {{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burckhardt p. 46|c}}

The Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy. [[Plato]]nic and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated.  Islamic alchemists such as [[Abu Bakr Mohammad Ibn Zakariya al-Razi|al-Razi]] (Latin Rasis or Rhazes) contributed key chemical discoveries of their own, such as the technique of [[distillation]] (the words ''[[alembic]]'' and ''[[alcohol]]'' are of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin), the [[hydrochloric acid|muriatic]], [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]], and [[nitric acid|nitric]] acids, [[sodium carbonate|soda]], [[potash]], and more. (From the Arabic names of the last two substances, ''al-natrun'' and ''al-qalīy'', Latinized into ''Natrium'' and ''Kalium'', come the modern symbols for [[sodium]] and [[potassium]].) The discovery that [[aqua regia]], a mixture of nitric and muriatic acids, could dissolve the noblest metal; gold, was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium.

Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism.  
The most influential author in this regard was arguably [[Abu Musa Jabir Ibn Hayyan|Jabir Ibn Hayyan]] (Arabic &amp;#1580;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1585; &amp;#1573;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1606; &amp;#1581;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1606;, Latin Geberus; usually rendered in English as Geber). Jabir's ultimate goal was [[takwin]], the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to and including human life. He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of ''hotness'', ''coldness'', ''dryness'', and ''moistness''. {{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burkhardt, p. 29|d}}  According to Geber, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist.  Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result. {{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burckhardt, p. 29|e}} By this reasoning, the search for the [[philosopher's stone]] was introduced to Western alchemy. Jabir developed an elaborate [[numerology]] whereby the root letters of a substance's name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element's physical properties. 

It is now commonly accepted that Chinese alchemy influenced Arabic alchemists {{ref_harvard|Edwardes|Edwardes pp. 33-59|a}}{{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burckhardt, p. 10-22|f}}, although the extent of that influence is still a matter of debate. Likewise, [[Hinduism|Hindu]] learning was assimilated into Islamic alchemy, but again the extent and effects of this are not well known.

===Alchemy in Medieval Europe===
[[Image:JosephWright-Alchemist-1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''The Alchemist in Search of the Philosophers Stone''. By [[Joseph Wright of Derby]], [[1771]].]]
Because of its strong connections to the Greek and Roman cultures, alchemy was rather easily accepted into Christian philosophy, and Medieval European alchemists extensively absorbed Islamic alchemical knowledge.  [[Gerbert of Aurillac]], who was later to become [[Pope Silvester II]], (d. 1003) was among the first to bring Islamic science to Europe from [[Spain]].  Later men such as [[Adelard of Bath]], who lived in the 12th century, brought additional learning.  But until the 13th century the moves were mainly assimilative. {{ref_harvard|Hollister|Hollister p. 124, 294|a}}

In this period there appeared some deviations from the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] principles of earlier Christian thinkers. [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm]] (1033–1109) was a Benedictine who believed faith must precede rationalism, as Augustine and most theologians prior to Anselm had believed, but Anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context.  His views set the stage for the philosophical explosion to occur. [[Peter Abelard]] followed Anselm's work, laying the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle reached the West.  His major influence on alchemy was his belief that Platonic universals did not have a separate existence outside of man's [[consciousness]]. Abelard also systematized the analysis of philosophical contradictions. {{ref_harvard|Hollister|Hollister, p. 287-8|b}}

[[Robert Grosseteste]] (1170–1253) was a pioneer of the scientific theory that would later be used and refined by the alchemists.  He took
Abelard's methods of analysis and added the use of observations, experimentation, and conclusions in making scientific evaluations. Grosseteste also did much work to bridge Platonic and Aristotelian thinking. {{ref_harvard|Hollister|Hollister pp. 294-5|c}}

[[Albertus Magnus]] (1193–1280) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) were both [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s who studied Aristotle and worked at reconciling the differences between philosophy and Christianity.  Aquinas also did a great deal of work in developing the [[scientific method]].  He even went as far as claiming that universals could be discovered only through [[logical reasoning]], and, since [[reason]] could not run in opposition to God, reason must be compatible with [[theology]]. {{ref_harvard|Hollister|Hollister p. 290-4, 355|d}}. This ran contrary to the commonly held Platonic belief that universals were found through [[divine illumination]] alone. Magnus and Aquinas were among the first to take up the examination of alchemical theory, and could be considered to be alchemists themselves, except that these two did little in the way of [[experimentation]]. 

The first true alchemist in Medieval Europe was [[Roger Bacon]].  His work did as much for alchemy as [[Robert Boyle]]'s was to do for [[chemistry]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s for [[astronomy]] and [[physics]]. Bacon (1214–1294) was an Oxford [[Franciscan]] who explored [[optics]] and [[linguistics|languages]] in addition to alchemy. The Franciscan ideals of taking on the world rather than rejecting the world led to his conviction that experimentation was more important than reasoning: &quot;Of the three ways in which men think that they acquire [[knowledge]] of things: authority, [[reason|reasoning]], and [[experience]]; only the last is effective and able to bring peace to the intellect.&quot; (Bacon p. 367) &quot;[[Experimental Science]] controls the conclusions of all other sciences. It reveals truths which reasoning from [[law (principle)|general principles]] would never have discovered.&quot; {{ref_harvard|Hollister|Hollister p. 294-5|e}}  Roger Bacon has also been attributed with originating the search for the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life: &quot;That medicine which will remove all impurities and corruptibilities from the lesser metals will also, in the opinion of the wise, take off so much of the corruptibility of the body that human life may be prolonged for many centuries.&quot; The idea of [[immortality]] was replaced with the notion of [[longevity|long life]]; after all, man's time on Earth was simply to wait and prepare for immortality in the world of God. Immortality on Earth did not mesh with Christian theology.  {{ref_harvard|Edwardes|Edwardes p. 37-8|b}}

Bacon was not the only alchemist of the high middle ages, but he was the most significant. His works were used by countless alchemists of the fifteenth through nineteenth centuries. Other alchemists of Bacon's time shared several traits. First, and most obviously, nearly all were members of the clergy.  This was simply because few people outside the parochial schools had the education to examine the Arabic-derived works.  Also, alchemy at this time was sanctioned by the church as a good method of exploring and developing theology. Alchemy was interesting to the wide variety of churchmen because it offered a rationalistic view of the universe when men were just beginning to learn about rationalism. {{ref_harvard|Edwardes|Edwardes p. 24-7|c}}

So by the end of the thirteenth century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (e.g., if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the [[soul|human soul]].) They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded [[jargon]] set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made [[observation]]s and [[theory|theories]] about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam.  By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God. {{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burckhardt p. 149|g}}

In the fourteenth century, these views underwent a major change. [[William of Ockham]], an [[Oxford]] Franciscan who died in 1349, attacked the [[Thomist]] view of compatibility between faith and reason. His view, widely accepted today, was that God must be accepted on faith alone; He could not be limited by human reason. Of course this view was not incorrect if one accepted the postulate of a limitless God versus limited human reasoning capability, but it virtually erased alchemy from practice in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  {{ref_harvard|Hollister|Hollister p. 335|f}} [[Pope John XXII]] in the early 1300s issued an edict against alchemy, which effectively removed all church personnel from the practice of the Art. {{ref_harvard|Edwardes|Edwardes, p.49|d}} The climate changes, [[Black Death|Black plague]], and increase in [[war|warfare]] and [[famine]] that characterized this century no doubt also served to hamper philosophical pursuits in general.

[[Image:flamel-figures.png|thumb|250px|[[Nicholas Flamel]] had these mysterious alchemical symbols carved on his [[tomb]] in the Church of the [[Holy Innocents]] in Paris.]]
Alchemy was kept alive by men such as [[Nicolas Flamel]], who was noteworthy only because he was one of the few alchemists writing in those troubled times. Flamel lived from 1330 to 1417 and would serve as the [[archetype]] for the next phase of alchemy. He was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher's stone, which he is reputed to have found; his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. Most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosophers' stone. {{ref_harvard|Burkhardt|Burckhardt pp.170-181|h}}

Through the [[high middle ages]] (1300-1500) alchemists were much like Flamel:  they concentrated on looking for the philosophers' stone and the elixir of youth, now believed to be separate things.  Their cryptic allusions and [[symbolism]] led to wide variations in interpretation of the art. For example, many alchemists during this period interpreted the purification of the soul to mean the [[transmutation]] of lead into gold (in which they believed elemental [[mercury (element)|mercury]], or 'quicksilver', played a crucial role). These men were viewed as [[magic (paranormal)|magicians and sorcerers]] by many, and were often persecuted for their practices. {{ref_harvard|Edwardes|Edwardes pp. 50-75|e}}{{ref_harvard|Norton|Norton pp lxiii-lxvii|a}}

One of these men who emerged at the beginning of the sixteenth century was named [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]. This alchemist believed himself to be a wizard and actually thought himself capable of summoning [[spiritual being|spirit]]s.  His influence was negligible, but like Flamel, he produced writings which were referred to by alchemists of later years. Again like Flamel, he did much to change alchemy from a mystical philosophy to an [[occult]]ist magic. He did keep alive the philosophies of the earlier alchemists, including experimental science, numerology, etc., but he added magic theory, which reinforced the idea of alchemy as an occultist belief.  In spite of all this, Agrippa still considered himself a Christian, though his views often came into conflict with the church. {{ref_harvard|Edwardes|Edwardes p.56-9|f}}{{ref_harvard|Wilson|Wilson p.23-9|a}}

===Alchemy in the Modern Age and Renaissance===
European alchemy continued in this way through the dawning of the [[Renaissance]].  The era also saw a flourishing of [[con artist]]s who would use chemical tricks and sleight of hand to &quot;demonstrate&quot; the transmutation of common metals into gold, or claim to possess secret knowledge that — with a &quot;small&quot; initial investment — would surely lead to that goal. 

The most important name in this period is Philippus Aureolus [[Paracelsus]], (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541) who cast alchemy into a new form, rejecting some of the occultism that had accumulated over the years and promoting the use of observations and experiments to learn about the human body. He rejected Gnostic traditions, but kept much of the Hermetical, neo-Platonic, and Pythagorean philosophies; however, Hermetical science had so much Aristotelian theory that his rejection of Gnosticism was practically meaningless. In particular, Paracelsus rejected the magic theories of Agrippa and Flamel. He did not think of himself as a magician, and scorned those who did. (Williams p.239-45) 

Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine, and wrote &quot;Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines.&quot; {{ref_harvard|Edwardes|Edwardes, p.47|g}} His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm. He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification  but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them. {{ref_harvard|Debus|Debus &amp; Multhauf, p.6-12|a}} While his attempts of treating diseases with such remedies as Mercury might seem ill-advised from a modern point of view, his basic idea of chemically produced medicines has stood time surprisingly well.

[[Image:Alchemik Sedziwoj Matejko.JPG|thumb|left|400px|Alchemist Michal Sedziwoj|&quot;Alchemik Michał Sędziwój&quot;, oil on board by [[Jan Matejko]], 73 x 130 cm, Museum of Arts in [[Łódź]].]]
In [[England]], the topic of alchemy in that time frame is often associated  with Doctor [[John Dee]] ([[13 July]] [[1527]] – December, 1608), better known for his role as [[astrologer]], cryptographer, and general &quot;scientific consultant&quot; to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Dee was considered an authority on the works of [[Roger Bacon]], and was interested enough in alchemy to write a book on that subject (''Monas Hieroglyphica'', 1564) influenced by the [[Kabbala]]. Dee's associate [[Edward Kelley]] — who claimed to converse with [[angel]]s through a crystal ball and to own a powder that would turn [[mercury (element)|mercury]] into [[gold]] — may have been the source of the popular image of the alchemist-charlatan. 

Another lesser known alchemist was [[Michał Sędziwój|Michael Sendivogius]] (''Michał Sędziwój'', 1566 - 1636), a [[Poland|Polish]] alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry. According to some accounts, he distilled [[oxygen]] in a lab sometime around 1600, 170 years before [[Karl Wilhelm Scheele|Scheele]] and [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]], by warming nitre ([[saltpetre]]). He thought of the gas given off as &quot;the elixir of life&quot;. Shortly after discovering this method, it is believed that Sendivogious taught his technique to [[Cornelius Drebbel]]. In 1621, Drebbel practically applied this in a submarine.

[[Tycho Brahe]] (1546–1601), better known for his [[astronomical]] and [[astrological]] investigations, was also an alchemist. He had a laboratory built for that purpose at his [[Uraniborg]] observatory/research institute.

===The decline of Western alchemy===
The demise of Western alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for &quot;ancient wisdom&quot;. Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its apogee in the 18th century.

[[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691), better known for his studies of gases (cf. [[Boyle's law]]) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations. He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data; in a typical experiment, Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, the position of the Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant.  {{ref_harvard|Pilkington|Pilkington p.11|a}} This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the [[18th century|18th]] and [[19th century|19th]] centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]] and [[John Dalton]] — which finally provided a logical, quantitative and reliable framework for understanding matter transmutations, and revealed the futility of longstanding alchemical goals such as the philospher's stone.

Meanwhile, Paracelsian alchemy led to the development of modern medicine.  Experimentalists gradually uncovered the workings of the human body, such as blood circulation ([[William Harvey|Harvey]], [[1616]]), and eventually traced many diseases to infections with germs ([[Robert Koch|Koch]] and [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]], 19th century) or lack of ''natural'' nutrients and [[vitamin]]s ([[James Lind|Lind]], [[Christiaan Eijkman|Eijkman]], [[Casimir Funk|Funk]], et al.). Supported by parallel developments in organic chemistry, the new science easily displaced alchemy from its medical roles, interpretive and prescriptive, while deflating its hopes of miraculous elixirs and exposing the ineffectiveness or even toxicity of its remedies.

Thus, as science steadily continued to uncover and rationalize the clockwork of the universe, founded on its own materialistic metaphysics, Alchemy was left deprived of its chemical and medical connections — but still incurably burdened by them.  Reduced to an arcane philosophical system, poorly connected to the material world, it suffered the common fate of other [[esoteric]] disciplines such as [[astrology]] and [[Kabbalah]]: excluded from [[university]] curricula, shunned by its former patrons, [[damned knowledge|ostracized]] by scientists, and commonly viewed as the epitome of [[charlatan]]ism and [[superstition]].

These developments could be interpreted as part of a broader reaction in European intellectualism against the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement of the preceding century. Be as it may, it is sobering to observe how a discipline that held so much intellectual and material prestige, for more than two thousand years, could disappear so easily from the universe of Western thought.

===Modern 'alchemy'===
In modern times, progress has been made toward achieving the goals of alchemy using scientific, rather than alchemic, means.  These developments may on occasion be called &quot;alchemy&quot; for rhetorical reasons.

In 1919, [[Ernest Rutherford]] used [[artificial disintegration]] to convert nitrogen into oxygen. This process of bombarding the atomic nucleus with high energy particles is the principle behind modern [[particle accelerators]], in which transmutations of elements are common. Indeed, in 1980, [[Glenn Seaborg]] transmuted lead into gold, though the amount of energy used and the microscopic quantities created negated any possible financial benefit.

In 1964,  [[George Ohsawa]] and [[Michio Kushi]], based on the claims of [[Louis Kervran]], reportedly successfully transmutated [[sodium]] into [[potassium]], by use of an electric arc, and later of [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] into [[iron]]. In 1994, [[R. Sundaresan]] and [[J. Bockris]] reported that they had observed fusion reactions in electrical discharges between carbon rods immersed in water. However, none of these claims have been replicated by other scientists, and the idea is now thoroughly discredited.

As of 2006, a universal panacea remains elusive, though [[futurist]]s such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] believe sufficiently advanced [[nanotechnology]] may prolong life indefinitely. Some say the third goal of alchemy has been fulfilled by [[In vitro fertilization|IVF]] and the [[cloning]] of a human embryo, although these technologies fall far short of creating a human life from scratch.

The aim of [[artificial intelligence]] research could be said to be creating a life from scratch, and those philosophically opposed to the possibility of AI have compared it with alchemy, such as Herbert and Stuart Dreyfus in their 1960 paper ''Alchemy and AI''.

==Alchemy in art and entertainment ==
References to alchemy in art and entertainment are far too numerous to list.  Here we give only a few indicative samples.  More titles can be found in the [[philosopher's stone]] article.

===Novels and plays===
Many [[literature|writers]] lampooned alchemists and used them as the butt of [[satire|satirical]] attacks.  Two early and well-known examples are

*[[Geoffrey Chaucer]], ''[[The Canon's Yeoman's Prologue and Tale|Canon's Yeoman's Tale]]'' (ca. 1380). The main character, an alchemist on the way to [[Canterbury]], claims that he will &quot;pave it all of silver and of gold&quot;.
*[[Ben Jonson]], ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (ca 1610). In this five-act play, the characters set up an alchemy workshop to swindle people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast''' (also called '''ADS-B''') is a system by which [[aircraft|airplanes]] constantly broadcast their current position and altitude, category of aircraft, [[airspeed]], [[identification]], and whether the aircraft is turning, climbing or descending over a dedicated radio [[datalink]]. This functionality is known as &quot;ADS-B out&quot; and is the basic level of ADS-B functionality.

The ADS-B system was developed in the 1990s.  It relies on data from the [[Global Positioning System]], or any navigation system that provides an equivalent or better service. The maximum range of the system is line-of-sight, typically less than 200 [[nautical mile]]s (370 km). 

The ADS-B transmissions are received by [[air traffic control]] stations, and all other ADS-B equipped aircraft within reception range. Reception by aircraft of ADS-B data is known as &quot;ADS-B in&quot;. 

==Usage==
The initial use of ADS-B is expected to be by [[air traffic control]] and for surveillance purposes and for enhancing pilot situational awareness. ADS-B is lower cost than conventional radar and permits higher quality surveillance of airborne and surface movements.  ADS-B is effective in remote areas or in mountainous terrain where there is no radar coverage, or where radar coverage is limited. The outback of Australia is one such area where ADS-B will provide surveillance where previously none existed. ADS-B also enhances surveillance on the airport surface, so it can also be used to monitor traffic on the taxiways and runways of an airport.  

ADS-B equipped aircraft may also have a [[display]] unit in the cockpit picturing surrounding air traffic from ADS-B data (ADS-B in) and TIS-B (Traffic Information Service-Broadcast) data derived from air traffic radar. Both Pilots and [[air traffic controller]]s will then be able to &quot;see&quot; the positions of air traffic in the vicinity of the aircraft, and this may be used to provide an ASAS (Airborne Separation Assurance System).

Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems may in the future also make use of &quot;ADS-B in&quot;, supplementing the existing TCAS collision avoidance system by what is called 'hybrid surveillance'.

Airbus and Boeing are now expected to include ADS-B out (i.e. the transmitter of information) as standard on new-build aircraft from 2005 onwards. This is in part due to the European requirements for Mode S Elementary Surveillance (which uses 1090MHz Mode S transponder which now is normally capable of ADS-B via Extended Squitter), and some common functionality with ADS-B out. 



==Addressed and Broadcast ADS==
The Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics’ ([[RTCA]]) Free Flight Selection Committee defines surveillance as “detection, tracking, characterization and observation of aircraft, other vehicles and weather phenomena for the purpose of conducting flight operations in a safe and efficient manner.&quot;

Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) is described as the process of creating and sending a message including the sender’s current position and other surveillance information, such as velocity, intent and flight identification. This information supports aircraft separation management by improving surveillance information at increased ranges, situational awareness and decision making. ADS data can be used in cooperation with data from current radar beacon systems, such as Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon Systems (ATCRBS), Mode S, Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) and primary Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar, and may also be used as a sole means of surveillance.

There are two commonly recognized types of ADS for aircraft applications:
*ADS-Addressed (ADS-A), also known as ADS-Contract (ADS-C), and 
*ADS-Broadcast (ADS-B.

ADS-A provides a surveillance data report that is sent to a specific addressee. For example, ADS-A reports are employed in the Future Air Navigation System (FANS) using the Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System ([[ACARS]]) as the communication protocol. During transoceanic flight, reports are periodically sent by an aircraft to the controlling air traffic region.

When ADS-B is used, aircraft and other vehicles continuously broadcast a message including position, heading, velocity and intent. Other uses may include obstacles transmitting a position message. Aircraft, ground-based stations,  and other users monitoring the channels can receive the information and use it in a wide variety of applications. Because of this potential for broad utilization, a system using ADS-B is most often discussed as a replacement for or an augmentation to current methods of monitoring aeronautical traffic.

To understand the full capability of ADS-B, consider how the current Air Traffic Control system creates information. The radar measures the range and bearing of an aircraft. Bearing is measured by the position of the rotating radar antenna when it receives a response to its interrogation from the aircraft, and range is measured by the time it takes for the radar to receive the interrogation response. 

The antenna beam becomes wider as the aircraft get farther away, making the position information less accurate. Additionally, detecting changes in aircraft velocity requires several radar sweeps that are spaced several seconds apart. In contrast, a system using ADS-B creates and listens for periodic position and intent reports from aircraft. These reports are generated and distributed using precise
instruments, such as the global positioning system (GPS) and Mode S transponders, meaning integrity of the data is no longer susceptible to the range of the aircraft or the length of time between radar sweeps. The enhanced accuracy of the information will be used to improve safety, support a wide variety of applications and increase airport and airspace capacity.

Use of ADS-B for ground-based surveillance requires only ADS-B Out (transmit) capability on the aircraft. With the addition of ADS-B In (receive) capability, the potential for ADS-B applications grows significantly. Some of the equipment and services associated with ADS-B In capability include:
*Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI), a display of proximate traffic based on ADS-B reports from other aircraft and ground-based facilities.
*Traffic Information Services-Broadcast (TIS-B), a ground-based uplink report of proximate traffic that is under surveillance by ATC but is not ADS-B-equipped.  This service would be available even with limited ADS-B implementation.
*Flight Information Services-Broadcast (FIS-B), a ground-based uplink of flight information services and weather data.

==ADS-B Physical Layer==
Three link solutions are being proposed as the physical layer for relaying the ADS-B position reports: 
*1090 MHz Mode S Extended Squitter (ES), 
*Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) and 
*VHF Digital Link ([[VDL]]) Mode 4. 

===Mode S===
The FAA has announced its selection of the 1090 MHz ES and UAT as the mediums for the ADS-B system in the United States. 1090 MHz ES will be the primary medium for air carrier and high-performance commercial aircraft while UAT will be the primary medium for general aviation aircraft. 

Europe has also chosen 1090 MHz as the primary physical layer for ADS-B. However, the second medium has not yet been selected between UAT and VDL Mode 4.

With 1090 ES, the existing Mode S transponder (or a stand alone 1090 MHz transmitter) supports a message type known as the ES message. It is a periodic message that provides position, velocity, heading, time, and, in the future, intent. The basic ES does not offer intent since current flight management systems do not provide such data – called trajectory change points. To enable an aircraft to send an extended squitter message, the transponder is modified and aircraft position and other status information is routed to the transponder. ATC ground stations and TCAS-equipped aircraft already have the necessary 1090 MHz receivers to receive these signals, and would only require
enhancements to accept and process the additional information. 1090 ES will not support FIS-B, due to regulatory requirements.

===Universal Access Transceiver===
The UAT system is specifically designed for ADS-B operation. A 1 MHz channel in the 900 MHz frequency range is dedicated for transmission of airborne ADS-B reports and for broadcast of ground-based aeronautical information. UAT users would have access to the additional ground-based aeronautical data and would receive reports from proximate traffic (FIS-B and TIS-B).  

===VDL Mode 4===
The VDL Mode 4 system could utilize one or more of the existing aeronautical VHF frequencies as the radio frequency physical layer for ADS-B transmissions. VDL Mode 4 uses a protocol (STDMA) that allows it to be self-organizing, meaning no master ground station is required. This medium is best used for short message transmissions from a large number of users. VDL Mode 4 systems are capable of increased range in comparison to L Band Mode S (1090 MHz) or UAT systems. 

==Implementation Timetable==
The timetable for airborne ADS-B equipage will be determined by ground and airborne facility implementation, equipment cost, perceived benefits of equipping and regulatory actions by the Civil Aviation Authorities (CAA). The cost to equip with ADS-B Out capability is relatively small and would benefit the airspace by enabling increased situational awareness. ADS-B In capability can provide additional benefits when ground stations and the critical mass of aircraft are also equipped. This data was taken into consideration when building the following estimated implementation timetable. 

===Near-term Implementation (2006-2008)=== 
The next three years will see a continuation of ADS-B trials and some implementation in “pockets” where limited aircraft equipage can bring operational benefits. Some of these include:
*'''Capstone'''.  In Alaska, the FAA is conducting its Capstone program to improve surveillance in some of the more remote locations of Alaska and as a test bed for implementing elements of ADS-B into the ATC environment. Approximately 190 general aviation users have been equipped with GPS receivers, UAT transceivers and flight deck displays. In addition, 11 ground-based transceivers have been installed for radar-like services, and flight information services data (FIS-B), including weather information, is being uplinked from the ground. Phase II of the program will expand the coverage and add more than 250 additional users.
*'''Gulf of Mexico''' – In the Gulf of Mexico, where ATC radar coverage is incomplete, the FAA is locating ADS-B (1090 MHz) receivers on oil rigs and buoys to relay information received from aircraft equipped with ADS-B extended squitters back to the ATC centers to expand and improve surveillance coverage. 
*'''Australia'''.  Australia is implementing ADS-B trials in Queensland to test the feasibility of 1090 MHz ADS-B as an alternative to ground-based radar. ADS-B is expected to be a much more cost-effective method of providing ATC surveillance coverage for remote areas which currently have limited or no surveillance coverage.
*'''Cargo Airline Association'''.  Cargo carriers operating at their hub airports operate largely at night. Equipage of these aircraft with ADS-B and CDTI displays along with a ground-based transceiver at these hubs will allow better situational awareness at night and in inclement weather and offers the potential for increased airport traffic handling capability.
*'''Embry Riddle Aeronautical University'''.  Embry Riddle Aeronautical University is equipping the training aircraft at its two main campuses in Florida and Arizona with ADS-B capability as a safety enhancement. The FAA will provide FIS-B and TIS-B uplink capabilities in those areas in support of this equipage.
*'''Safe Flight 21 East Coast Broadcast Services'''.  The FAA has announced its intention to implement ADS-B coverage for the entire east coast of the U.S. by the end of 2004. Service range will extend inland 150 miles with a goal of providing coverage at altitudes down to 2,000 feet. The medium will be UAT and the implementation will also include TIS-B and FIS-B information.

===Mid-term Implementation (2008-2012)=== 
Within four to eight years, an increasing number of aircraft with ADS-B Out capability along with the start of ground-based ADS-B infrastructure will begin to make a number of ADS-B applications attractive.
*Benefits of “Pockets of Implementation” will become evident and these areas will be expanded, encouraging more users to equip with ADS-B capability.
*Beginning in 2004 the FAA is expected to deploy ADS-B ground infrastructure based on ASDE-X equipment. This infrastructure will allow the use of ADS-B data for ATC purposes such as surface movement tracking/guidance and airborne surveillance.
*Ground uplinks of TIS-B and FIS-B will commence where the ground infrastructure is deployed.
*Other Civil Aviation Authorities may install ADS-B ground infrastructure and require aircraft to be equipped with ADS-B Out for operation in selected airspace. Australia is expected to be the first country to do so; however, a number of other countries with limited surveillance coverage may find ADS-B an attractive alternative to radar surveillance.
*Significant numbers of users will become equipped with a minimum of ADS-B Out capability. In Europe, 1090 MHz ES will become standard capability for all new Mode S transponder installations after 31 March, 2005. UAT will become increasingly popular in the upper end of the general aviation market.
*Airport Situational Awareness – A combination of detailed airport maps, airport multilateration (ASDE-X) systems, enhanced aircraft displays and ADS-B have the potential to significantly improve Runway situational awareness.
*Oceanic In-trail – ADS-B can provide enhanced situational awareness and safety for Oceanic In-trail maneuvers as additional aircraft become equipped.
*Use of ADS-B and CDTI will allow decreased approach spacing and closely spaced parallel approaches at congested airports with improved safety and capacity during low-/lower-visibility operations.

===Long-term Implementations (2012 and beyond)===
*Air carriers’ fleets will achieve intended ADS-B benefits in the terminal and en route airspace.
*New Aircraft Separation Assurance applications will take advantage of the increased situational awareness and positional accuracy available in an airspace environment largely equipped with ADS-B capability.
*FIS-B and TIS-B services will encourage general aviation equipage in all market segments.

The '''Republic of Austria''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Republik Österreich)'' is a [[landlocked]] country in central [[Central Europe|Europe]]. It borders [[Germany]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the north, [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] to the east, [[Slovenia]] and [[Italy]] to the south, and [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] to the west.  The capital is the city of [[Vienna]].

Austria is a parliamentary [[representative democracy]] consisting of nine federal states and is one of two European countries that have declared their everlasting [[neutral country|neutrality]], the other being Switzerland. Austria is a member of the [[United Nations]] (since 1955) and the [[European Union]] (since 1995). For the first half of 2006 Austria holds the seat of the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the EU]].

==Origin and history of the name==
The [[German language|German]] name ''Österreich'' can be translated into [[English language|English]] as the &quot;eastern realm&quot;, which is derived from the [[Old German]] ''[[Ostarrîchi]]''. ''Reich'' can also mean &quot;empire&quot;, and this connotation is the one that is understood in the context of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]/[[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], although not in the context of the modern Republic of ''Österreich''. The term probably originates in a [[vernacular]] translation of the [[Medieval Latin]] name for the region: ''Marchia orientalis'', which translates as &quot;eastern border&quot;, as it was situated at the eastern edge of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], that was also mirrored in the name ''[[Ostmark]]'' applied after ''[[Anschluss]]'' to [[Germany]].

==History==
{{details|History of Austria}}

===Austria and the Holy Roman Empire===
The territory of Austria originally known as the [[Celts|Celtic]] kingdom of [[Noricum]], was a long time ally of Rome. It was occupied rather than conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] during the reign of [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] and made the province Noricum  in [[16 BC]]. Later it was conquered by [[Huns]], Rugii,  [[Lombards]], [[Ostrogoth]]s, [[Bavarii]], [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] (until c. 800),  and [[Franks]] (in that order). Finally, after 48 years of Hungarian rule (907 to 955), the core territory of Austria was awarded to [[Leopold I of Austria (Babenberg)| Leopold of Babenberg]] in 976. Being part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] the Babenbergs ruled and expanded Austria from the 10th century to the 13th century.

After Duke [[Frederick II]] died in 1246 and left no successor, [[Rudolf I of Habsburg]] gave the lands to his sons marking the beginning of the line of the [[Habsburg]]s, who continued to govern Austria until the 20th century.

With the short exception of [[Charles VII Albert]] of Bavaria, Austrian Habsburgs held the position of German Emperor beginning in 1438 with [[Albert II of Habsburg]] until the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the [[14th century|14th]] and 15th century Austria continued to expand its territory until it reached the position of a European imperial power at the end of the 15th century until the end of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918.

===Modern history===
Just two years before the abolition of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, in 1804 the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]] was founded, which was transformed in 1867 into the dual-monarchy [[Austria-Hungary]]. The empire was split into several independent states in 1918, after the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], with most of the German-speaking parts becoming a [[republic]]. (See [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]].) Between 1918 and 1919 it was officially known as the Republic of German Austria (''Republik Deutschösterreich''). After the [[Entente]] powers forbade German Austria to unite with Germany, they also forbade the name, and then it was changed to simply Republic of Austria. The democratic republic lasted until 1933 when the chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuß]] established an autocratic regime oriented towards Italian fascism ([[Austrofascism]]).

Austria became part of [[Germany]] in 1938 through the [[Anschluß]] and remained under [[Nazis|Nazi]] rule until the end of [[World War II]]. After the defeat of the [[Axis Powers]], the [[Potsdam Conference|Allies occupied Austria]] until 1955, when the country became a fully independent republic under the condition that it would remain neutral (see: [[Austrian State Treaty]]). Austria also became a member of the UN in the same year. After the collapse of [[communist state]]s in [[Eastern Europe]], Austria became increasingly involved in European affairs, and in 1995, Austria joined the [[European Union]], and the [[Euro]] monetary system in 1999.

==Politics==
{{details|Politics of Austria}}
[[image:AustrianParliament.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Austrian Parliament in Vienna]]

Austria became a federal, [[parliamentary democracy|parliamentarian, democratic]] [[republic]] through the [[Federal Constitution (Austria)|Federal Constitution]] of 1920. It was reintroduced in 1945 to the nine [[States of Austria|states]] of the Federal Republic. The [[head of state]] is the [[President of Austria|Federal President]], who is directly elected. The chairman of the [[Government of Austria|Federal Government]] is the [[Chancellor of Austria|Federal Chancellor]], who is appointed by the president. The government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by [[vote of no confidence]] in the lower chamber of parliament, the [[National Council of Austria|Nationalrat]].

The [[Parliament of Austria]] consists of two chambers. The composition of the Nationalrat is determined every four years by a free general election in which every citizen is allowed to vote to fill its 183 seats. A &quot;Four Percent Hurdle&quot; prevents a large splintering of the political landscape in the Nationalrat by awarding seats only to political parties that have obtained at least a four percent threshold of the general vote, or alternatively, have won a direct seat, or ''Direktmandat'', in one of the 43 regional election districts. The Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in Austria. However, the upper house of parliament, the [[Federal Council of Austria|Bundesrat]] has a limited right of [[veto]] (the Nationalrat can - in most cases - pass the respective bill a second time bypassing the Bundesrat altogether). A convention, called the ''Österreich&amp;ndash;Konvent'' [http://www.konvent.gv.at/] was convened in [[June 30]], [[2003]] to decide upon suggestions to reform the constitution, but has failed to produce a proposal that would receive the two thirds of votes in the Nationalrat necessary for constitutional amendments and/or reform. However some important parts of the final report were generally agreed upon and are still expected to be implemented.

==Subdivisions==
{{details|States of Austria}}

A federal republic, Austria is divided into nine [[states]], ([[German language|German]]: ''[[States of Austria|Bundesländer]]''). These states are divided into [[district]]s (''[[Bezirke]]'') and cities (''[[Statutarstadt|Statutarstädte]]'').  Districts are subdivided into municipalities (''Gemeinden''). Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. The states are not mere administrative divisions, but have some distinct legislative authority separate from the federal government.

==Geography==
{{details|Geography of Austria}}

[[image:Oesterreich topo.png|thumb|left|240px|Topography of Austria]]

Austria is a largely [[mountain]]ous country due to its location in the [[Alps]]. The [[Central Eastern Alps]], [[Northern Limestone Alps]] and [[Southern Limestone Alps]] are all partly in Austria.  Of the total area of Austria (84,000 km² or 32,000&amp;nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&amp;nbsp;mi]]), only about a quarter can be considered low lying, and only 32% of the country is below 500 [[metre]]s (1,640&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]).  The high mountainous Alps in the west of Austria flatten somewhat into low lands and plains in the east of the country.

[[Image:Au-map.png|thumb|right|240px|Map of Austria]]

Austria may be divided into 5 different areas.  The biggest area are the [[Eastern Alps|Austrian Alps]], which constitute 62% of Austria's total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the [[Alps]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]]s account for around 12% of its area.  The foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower than the Alps) is situated in the north.  Known as the Austrian [[granite]] [[plateau]], it is located in the central area of the Bohemian Mass, and accounts for 10% of Austria.  The Austrian portion of the [[Viennese basin]] comprises the remaining 4%.

===Climate===
The greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate [[climate zone]] in which humid westerly winds predominate. With over half of the country dominated by the [[Alps]] the [[alpine climate]] is the predominant one. In the East the climate shows continental features with less rain than the areas with high rainfall averages. 
The six highest mountains in Austria are:

==Economy==
{{details|Economy of Austria}}
[[Image:20ec_oes.png|320px|right|frame| The [[Belvedere (palace)|Belvedere]] Palace, an example of the [[Baroque]] ]]

Austria has a well-developed [[social market economy]] and a high [[standard of living]]. Until the 1980s many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised, however in recent years privatisation has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. Labour movements are particularly strong in Austria and have large influence on labour politics.

[[Germany]] has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the [[German economy]]. Slow growth in Germany and elsewhere in the world affected Austria, slowing its growth to 1.2% in 2001. But since Austria became a member state of the [[European Union]] it has gained closer ties to other [[European Union]] economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany. In addition, membership in the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European market and proximity to EU aspiring economies. Therefore estimates of growth in 2005 (up to 2%) are much more favourable than in the crippling German economy.

'''Agriculture''': Austrian farms, like those of other west European mountainous countries, are small and fragmented, and production is relatively expensive.

'''Industry''':  Although some industries, such as several iron and steel works and chemical plants, are large industrial enterprises employing thousands of people, most industrial and commercial enterprises in Austria are relatively small on an international scale.

'''Services''': Like in other western countries, the biggest contributor to Austria's GDP is its service sector. Most notably is [[tourism]], especially [[winter]] [[tourism]].

To meet increased competition from both EU and Central European countries, Austria will need to emphasize knowledge-based sectors of the economy, continue to deregulate the [[service sector]], and lower its tax burden.

==Demographics==
{{details|Demographics of Austria}}
[[image:1Canaletto-Wien-Belvedere.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Vienna]] during the first half of the 18th century, painting by [[Canaletto]].]]

Austria's capital [[Vienna]] is one of Europe's major cities with a population exceeding 1.6 million (2 million with suburbs) and constitutes a ''melting pot'' of citizens from all over Central and Eastern Europe. In contrast to this ''Metropolis'', other cities do not exceed 1 million inhabitants, in fact the second largest [[city]] [[Graz]] is home of 305,000 people (followed by [[Linz]] with 180,000, [[Salzburg]] with 145,000 and [[Innsbruck]] with 134,803 (2005). All other cities have fewer than 100,000 inhabitants.

Austrians of German mother tongue, by far the country's largest group, form 91.1% of Austria's population. The remaining [[number]] of Austria's people are of non-Austrian descent, many from surrounding countries, especially from the former [[Eastern Bloc|East Bloc]] nations. The Austrian federal states of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Styria (state)|Styria]] are home to a significant (indigenous) Slovenian minority with around 14,000 members (Austrian census; unofficial numbers of Slovene groups speak of about 40,000). So-called guest workers ''(Gastarbeiter)'' and their descendants also form an important [[minority group]] in Austria. Around 20,000 [[Hungarians]] and 30,000 [[Croatians]] live in the east-most Bundesland, [[Burgenland]] (formerly part of Hungary).

The official language, [[German language|German]], is spoken by almost all residents of the country. Austria's mountainous terrain led to the development of many distinct German dialects. All of the dialects in the [[country]], however, belong to [[Austro-Bavarian]] groups of German dialects, with the exception of the dialect spoken in its west-most Bundesland, [[Vorarlberg]], which belongs to the group of [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialects.
There is also a distinct grammatical standard for [[Austrian language|Austrian]] German with a few differences to the German spoken in Germany.

===Politics concerning ethnic groups (Volksgruppenpolitik)===
An estimated 25,000-40,000 [[Slovenians]] in the Austrian state of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] as well as Croatians and [[Hungarians]] in Burgenland were recognized as a minority and have enjoyed special rights following the Austrian State Treaty (Staatsvertrag) of 1955. The Slovenians in the Austrian state of [[Styria (state)|Styria]] (estimated at a number between 1,600 and 5,000) are not recognized as a minority and do not enjoy special rights, although the State Treaty of July 27, 1955 states otherwise.
The right for bilingual topographic signs for the regions where Slovene and Croatian speaking Austrians live alongside with the German speaking population (as required by the 1955 State Treaty) is still to be fully implemented. There is also an undercurrent of thinking amongst parts of the Carenthian population that the [[Slovenian]] involvement in the partisan war against the [[Nazi]] occupation force was a bad thing, and indeed &quot;Tito partisan&quot; is a not an infrequent insult hurled against members of the minority. Many Carinthians are afraid of Slovenian territorial claims, pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two World Wars and considering that some official Slovenian atlases still show parts of Carinthia as Slovenian cultural territory. The current governor, [[Jörg Haider]], has made this fact a matter of public argument in fall 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the Kärntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view.  Another interesting phenomenon is the so called &quot;Windischen-Theorie&quot; [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windischen-Theorie] stating that the Slovenians can be split in two groups: actual Slovenians and Windische, based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenians, who were taught Slovenian standard language in school and those Slovenians, who spoke their local Slovenian dialect but went to German schools. To the latter group the term &quot;Windische&quot; (originally the German word for Slovenians) was applied, claiming that they were a different ethnic group. This theory was never generally accepted and has been ultimately rejected several decades ago.

==Religion==
[[Image:Emperor_charles_v.png|thumb|right|250px|'''Charles V''' Austrian Habsburg ruler and one of the major figures within the [[Counter-Reformation]].]]

While northern and central Germany was the origin of the [[Reformation]], Austria (and Bavaria) were the heart of the [[Counter-Reformation]] in the [[16th century|16th]] and [[17th century|17th]] century, when the absolute monarchy of [[Habsburg]] imposed a strict regime to maintain [[Catholicism]]'s power and influence among Austrians. Despite this establishment of Catholicism as the predominant [[Christian]] religion (Protestants have throughout Austria's history remained a relatively small group), Austria's history as a multinational state has made it necessary for Habsburg rulers to deal with a heterogeneous religious population. Religious freedom was declared a constitutional right as early as 1867 and [[Austria-Hungary]] was home of numerous religions beside [[Roman Catholicism]] such as Greek, Serbian, Romanian, Russian, and Bulgarian [[Orthodox Christians]], [[Jew]]s,  [[Muslims]] (Austria neighboured the [[Ottoman empire]] for centuries), [[Mormons]] and both [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] and [[Lutheran]] [[Protestants]].

Still Austria remained largely influenced by Catholicism. After 1918 First Republic Catholic leaders such as [[Theodor Innitzer]] and [[Ignaz Seipel]] took leading positions within or close to the Austrian Government and increased their influence during the time of the [[Austrofascism]] – Catholicism was treated much like a [[state religion]] by dictators [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and [[Kurt Schuschnigg]]. Although Catholic leaders welcomed the Germans in 1938 during the [[Anschluss]] of Austria into [[Germany]], Austrian Catholicism stopped its support of [[Nazism]] later on and many former religious public figures became involved with the resistance during the [[Third Reich]]. After 1945 a stricter secularism was imposed in Austria and religious influence on politics has nearly vanished.

As of the end of the 20th century about 73% of Austria's population are registered as Roman Catholic, while about 5% consider themselves [[Protestant]]s. Both these numbers have been on the decline for decades, especially Roman Catholicism, which has suffered an increasing number of seceders of the church. This is due partly to [[child sexual abuse]] scandals by priests as well as the alleged unwillingness of the Roman Catholic Church to implement reforms. In addition, Austrian Catholics are obliged to pay a mandatory tax (calculated by income – ca 1%) to the Austrian Roman Catholic Church, which acts as another incentive to leave the church.

About 12% of the population declare that they do not belong to any [[church]] or religious community. Of the remaining people, about 180,000 are members of the [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern Orthodox Church]] and about 7,300 are [[Judaism|Jewish]]. It has to be noted that the Austrian Jewish Community of 1938 – Vienna alone counted more than 200,000, of which solely 4,000 to 5,000 remained after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The influx of [[Eastern Europe|Eastern Europeans]], especially from the former Yugoslav nations, Albania and particularly from [[Turkey]] largely contributed to a substantial Muslim minority in Austria – around 300,000 are registered as members of various Muslim communities. The numbers of people adhering to the [[Islam]] has increased largely during the last years and is expected to grow in the future. [[Buddhism in Austria|Buddhism]], which was legally recognized as a religion in Austria in 1983, enjoys widespread acceptance and has a following of 20,000 (10,402 at the 2001 [[census]]).
A 2005 survey among 8,000 people in various [[Europe]]an countries showed that Austrians are still among the countries with the strongest belief in [[god (monotheism)|God]]. 84% of all Austrians do state they believe in God, with only [[Poland]] (97%), [[Portugal]] (90%) and [[Russia]] (87%) in front of the countries surveyed. This is a much larger figure than the European average of 71% or [[Germany]] with 67%.

==Culture==
{{details|Culture of Austria}}
{{Austrians}}
[[image:Wittgenstein2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Ludwig Wittgenstein]]

Although Austria is a small country, its history as a world power and its unique cultural environment in the heart of Europe have generated contributions to mankind in every possible field. One might argue that Austria is internationally best known for its musicians. It has been the birthplace of many [[Music of Austria|famous composers]] such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Haydn|Joseph Haydn]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johann Strauss, Sr.]], [[Johann Strauss, Jr.]] or [[Gustav Mahler]] as well as members of the [[Second Viennese School]] such as [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]] or [[Alban Berg]].

Complementing its status as a land of artists, Austria has always been a country of great poets, writers and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]] or [[Robert Musil]], of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] or [[Adalbert Stifter]]. Famous contemporary playwrights and novelists are [[Elfriede Jelinek]] and [[Peter Handke]]. Among Austrian artists and architects one can find painters [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Egon Schiele]] or [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]],  photographer [[Inge Morath]] or architect [[Otto Wagner]].

Austria was the cradle of numerous scientists including physicists [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Lise Meitner]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Richard von Mises]] and [[Christian Doppler]], philosophers [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]], biologists [[Gregor Mendel]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] as well as mathematician [[Kurt Gödel]]. It was home to psychologists [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Paul Watzlawick]] and [[Hans Asperger]], psychiatrist [[Viktor Frankl]], economists [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]] ([[Austrian School]]) and [[Peter Drucker]], and engineers such as [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Siegfried Marcus]]. 

Although Austrians can look back with pride on their cultural past, current Austria does not stand back in art and science. Austria hosts a tremendous amount of culture, with its classical music festivals in [[Vienna]], [[Salzburg]] and [[Bregenz]], its modern artists and writers, its theatres and opera houses.

&lt;!--PLEASE USE AUSTRALIAN ENGLISH THROUGHOUT THIS ARTICLE--&gt;
The '''Commonwealth of Australia''' is a country in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] comprising the world's smallest [[continent]] and a number of islands in the [[Southern Ocean|Southern]], [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s. Australia's neighbouring countries include [[Indonesia]], [[East Timor]] and [[Papua New Guinea]] to the north, the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]] and the [[France|French]] dependency of [[New Caledonia]] to the northeast, and [[New Zealand]] to the southeast.

The [[Australia (continent)|continent of Australia]] has been inhabited for over 40,000 years by [[Indigenous Australians]]. After sporadic visits by fishermen from the north and by [[Europe]]an explorers and merchants starting in the 17th century, the eastern half of the continent was claimed by the [[British]] in 1770 and officially settled as the [[penal colony]] of [[New South Wales]] on [[26 January]] [[1788]]. As the population grew and new areas were explored, another five largely self-governing [[British overseas territory|British Crown Colonies]] were successively established over the course of the 19th century.

On [[1 January]] [[1901]], the six colonies [[Federation of Australia|federated]] and the Commonwealth of Australia was formed. Since federation, Australia has maintained a stable [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] political system and remains a [[Commonwealth Realm]]. The current population of around 20.4 million is concentrated mainly in the large coastal cities of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and [[Adelaide]].

== Origin and history of the name ==
The name Australia is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''australis'', meaning ''southern''. Legends of an &quot;unknown southern land&quot; (''[[Terra Australis|terra australis incognita]]'') date back to the Roman times and were commonplace in mediaeval geography, but they were not based on any actual knowledge of the continent. The Dutch adjectival form ''Australische'' (&quot;Australian&quot;, in the sense of &quot;southern&quot;) was used by Dutch officials in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] to refer to the newly discovered land to the south as early as 1638. The first use of the word &quot;Australia&quot; in [[English language|English]] was a 1693 translation of ''Les Aventures de Jacques Sadeur dans la Découverte et le Voyage de la Terre Australe'', a 1692 French novel by [[Gabriel de Foigny]] under the pen name Jacques Sadeur {{ref|Baker}}. &lt;!-- there was a 1676 version, but it was suppressed --&gt;  [[Alexander Dalrymple]] then used it in ''An Historical Collection of Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean'', published in 1771. He used the term to refer to the entire South Pacific region, not specifically to the Australian continent. In 1793, [[George Shaw]] and [[James Edward Smith|Sir James Smith]] published ''Zoology and Botany of New Holland'', in which they wrote of &quot;the vast island, or rather continent, of Australia, Australasia or [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]].&quot;
[[Image:Flinders View of Port Jackson taken from South Head.jpg|200px|thumb|left|View of [[Port Jackson]], taken from the South Head, from ''A Voyage to Terra Australis''. [[Sydney]] was established on this site.]]
The name &quot;Australia&quot; was popularised by the 1814 work ''A Voyage to Terra Australis'' by the navigator [[Matthew Flinders]]. Despite its title, which reflected the view of the Admiralty, Flinders used the word &quot;Australia&quot; in the book, which was widely read and gave the term general currency. Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] of [[New South Wales]] subsequently used the word in his dispatches to [[England]]. In 1817 he recommended that it be officially adopted. In 1824, the British Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially as Australia.

The word &quot;Australia&quot; in [[Australian English]] is [[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] as either {{IPA|/ə.ˈstɹæɪ.ljə/}}, {{IPA|/ə.ˈstɹæɪ.liː.ə/}} or {{IPA|/ə.ˈstɹæɪ.jə/}}.

== History ==
{{main|History of Australia}}
The first human habitation of Australia is estimated to have occurred between 42,000 and 48,000 years ago.{{ref|Gillespie2002}} The first Australians were the ancestors of the current [[Indigenous Australians]]; they arrived via land bridges and short sea-crossings from present-day [[Southeast Asia]]. Most of these people were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, with a complex oral culture and spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Dreamtime]]. The [[Torres Strait Islanders]], ethnically [[Melanesia]]n, inhabited the [[Torres Strait Islands]] and parts of far-north [[Queensland]]; they possess distinct cultural practices from the Aborigines.
[[Image:Endeavour replica in Cooktown harbour.jpg|240px|left|thumb|Lieutenant [[James Cook]] charted the East coast of Australia on [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']], claiming the land for Britain in 1770. This replica was built in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] in 1988 for Australia's bicentenary.]]
The first undisputed recorded European sighting of the Australian continent was made by the Dutch navigator [[Willem Jansz]], who sighted the coast of [[Cape York Peninsula]] in 1606. During the 17th century, the Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines of what they called [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]], but made no attempt at settlement. In 1770, [[James Cook]] sailed along and mapped the east coast of Australia, which he named [[New South Wales]] and claimed for Britain. The expedition's discoveries provided impetus for the establishment of a [[penal colony]] there following the loss of the American colonies that had previously filled that role.
[[Image:Port Arthur Seeseite.jpg|260px|thumb|right|[[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]], [[Tasmania]] was Australia's largest penal colony.]]
The British [[British overseas territory|Crown Colony]] of New South Wales started with the establishment of a settlement at [[Port Jackson]] by Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] on [[26 January]] [[1788]]. This date was later to become Australia's national day, [[Australia Day]]. [[Van Diemen's Land]], now known as [[Tasmania]], was settled in 1803 and became a separate colony in 1825. The United Kingdom formally claimed the western part of Australia in 1829. Separate colonies were created from parts of New South Wales: [[South Australia]] in 1836, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1851, and [[Queensland]] in 1859. The [[Northern Territory]] (NT) was founded in 1863 as part of the Province of South Australia. Victoria and South Australia were founded as &quot;free colonies&quot; — that is, they were never penal colonies, although the former did receive some convicts from Tasmania. Western Australia was also founded &quot;free&quot;, but later accepted transported convicts due to an acute labour shortage. The transportation of convicts to Australia was phased out between 1840 and 1868.

The [[Indigenous Australian]] population, estimated at about 350,000 at the time of European settlement,{{ref|Smith1980}} declined steeply for 150 years following settlement, mainly due to infectious disease, forced migration, the [[Stolen Generation|removal of children]], and other colonial government policies that some historians and Indigenous Australians have argued could be considered tantamount to [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|genocide]] by today's understanding.{{ref|Tatz1999}} Such interpretations of Aboriginal history are disputed by some as being exaggerated or fabricated for political or ideological reasons.{{ref|wind2001}} {{ref|smh2002}} This debate is known within Australia as the [[History Wars]]. Following the [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]], the Federal government gained the power to implement policies and make laws with respect to Aborigines. Traditional ownership of land — [[native title]] — was not recognised until the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] case ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]'' overturned the notion of Australia as ''[[terra nullius]]'' at the time of European occupation.
[[Image:Anzac1.JPG|left|thumb|240px|The [[Last Post]] is played at an [[ANZAC Day]] ceremony in [[Port Melbourne, Victoria]], [[25 April]] [[2005]]. Ceremonies such as this are held in virtually every suburb and town in Australia.]] 
A [[gold rush]] began in Australia in the early 1850s, and the [[Eureka Stockade]] rebellion in 1854 was an early expression of nationalist sentiment. Between 1855 and 1890, the six colonies individually gained [[responsible government]], managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the [[British Empire]]. The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs, defence and international shipping. On [[1 January]] [[1901]], [[Federation of Australia|federation]] of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning, consultation and voting, and the Commonwealth of Australia was born, as a [[Dominion]] of the [[British Empire]]. The [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) was formed from New South Wales in 1911 to provide a location for the proposed new federal capital of [[Canberra]] ([[Melbourne]] was the capital from 1901 to 1927). The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the Commonwealth in 1911. Australia willingly participated in [[World War I]];{{ref|Bean1941}} many Australians regard the defeat of the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZACs) at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] as the birth of the nation — its first major military action. The Gallipoli campaign is often erroneously portrayed as or conceived to have been a solely or mainly ANZAC campaign. The reality was that British deaths during the campaign were twice as high as those of ANZAC forces. Much like Gallipoli, the [[Kokoda Track Campaign]] is regarded by many as a nation-defining battle from [[World War II]].

The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] formally ended most of the constitutional links between Australia and the United Kingdom, but Australia did not [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942|adopt the Statute]] until 1942. The shock of the United Kingdom's defeat in Asia in 1942 and the threat of Japanese invasion caused Australia to turn to the [[United States]] as a new ally and protector. Since 1951, Australia has been a formal military ally of the US under the auspices of the [[ANZUS]] treaty. After World War II, Australia encouraged mass immigration from Europe; since the 1970s and the abolition of the [[White Australia policy]], immigration from Asia and other parts of the world was also encouraged. As a result, Australia's demography, culture and image of itself were radically transformed. The final constitutional ties between Australia and the United Kingdom ended in 1986 with the passing of the [[Australia Act 1986]], ending any British role in the Australian States, and ending judicial appeals to the UK Privy Council. Australian voters rejected a move to become a republic in 1999 by a 55% majority,{{ref|AEC}} but the result is generally viewed in terms of dissatisfaction with the specifics of the proposed republican model rather than attachment to the monarchy. Since the election of the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam Government]] in 1972, there has been an increasing focus on the nation's future as a part of the Asia-Pacific region.

==Politics==
{{main articles|[[Government of Australia]] and [[Politics of Australia]]}}
[[Image:NewParliamentHouseInCanberra.jpg|thumb|right|240px|New [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]] was opened in 1988 replacing the [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|provisional Parliament House building]] opened in 1927.]]

The Commonwealth of Australia is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and has a [[parliamentary system]] of government. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] is the [[Queen of Australia]], a role that is distinct from her position as Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. The Queen is nominally represented by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]; although the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] gives extensive [[Executive (government)|executive powers]] to the Governor-General, these are normally exercised only on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]. The most notable exercise of the Governor-General's [[reserve power]]s outside the Prime Minister's direction was the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in the [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975|constitutional crisis of 1975]].{{ref|PL1997}}

There are three branches of government.
*The legislature: the [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth Parliament]], comprising the Queen, the Senate, and the House of Representatives; the Queen is represented by the Governor-General, who in practice exercises little or no power over the Parliament.
*The executive: the [[Federal Executive Council]] (the Governor-General as advised by the executive councillors); in practice, the councillors are the prime minister and ministers of state, whose advice the Governor-General accepts, with rare exceptions.
*The judiciary: the [[High Court of Australia]] and other [[Australian court hierarchy|federal courts]]. The State courts became formally independent from the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] when the ''[[Australia Act]]'' was passed in 1986.

The [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] Commonwealth Parliament consists of the Queen, the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] (the upper house) of 76 senators, and a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (the lower house) of 150 members. Members of the lower house are elected from single-member constituencies, commonly known as 'electorates' or 'seats'. Seats in the House of Representatives are allocated to states on the basis of population. In the Senate, each state, regardless of population, is represented by 12 senators, with the ACT and the NT each electing two. Elections for both chambers are held every three years; typically only half of the Senate seats are put to each election, because senators have overlapping six-year terms.  The party with majority support in the House of Representatives forms Government, with its leader becoming Prime Minister.

There are three major political parties: the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]], the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] and the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]]. Independent members and several minor parties — including the [[Australian Greens|Greens]], [[Family First Party|Family First]] and the [[Australian Democrats]] — have achieved representation in Australian parliaments, mostly in upper houses, although their influence has been marginal. Since the [[Australian legislative election, 1996|1996 election]], the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal/National Coalition]] led by the Prime Minister, [[John Howard]], has been in power in Canberra. In the [[Australian legislative election, 2004|2004 election]], the Coalition won control of the Senate, the first time that a party (or coalition of governing parties) has done so while in government in more than 20 years. The Labor Party is in power in every state and territory.  [[Compulsory voting|Voting is compulsory]] in each state and territory and at the federal level.

== States and territories==
{{main|States and territories of Australia}}
[[Image:Map of Australia.png|thumb|240px|States and territories of Australia]]
Australia consists of six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]. The two major mainland territories are the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory|Australian Capital Territory]].
In most respects, the territories function similarly to the states, but the Commonwealth Parliament can override any legislation of their parliaments. By contrast, federal legislation overrides state legislation only with respect to certain areas as set out in [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|Section 51]] of the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]]; all residual legislative powers are retained by the state parliaments, including powers over hospitals, education, police, the judiciary, roads, public transport and local government. 

Each state and territory has its own [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|legislature]] ([[Unicameralism|unicameral]] in the case of the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the remaining states). The [[lower house]] is known as the [[Legislative Assembly]] ([[House of Assembly]] in South Australia and Tasmania) and the [[upper house]] the [[Legislative Council]]. The [[head of government|heads of the governments]] in each state and territory are called [[Premiers of the Australian states|premiers]] and [[Chief Minister|chief ministers]], respectively. The Queen is represented in each state by a [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]]; an [[Administrator of the Northern Territory|administrator]] in the Northern Territory, and the Governor-General in the ACT, have analogous roles.

Australia also has several minor territories; the federal government administers a separate area within New South Wales, the [[Jervis Bay Territory]], as a naval base and sea port for the national capital. In addition Australia has the following, inhabited, external territories: [[Norfolk Island]], [[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], and several largely uninhabited external territories: [[Ashmore and Cartier Islands]], [[Coral Sea Islands]], [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] and the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]].

==Foreign relations and military==
{{main articles|[[Foreign relations of Australia]] and [[Australian Defence Force]]}}

Over recent decades, [[Foreign relations of Australia|Australia's foreign relations]] have been driven by a close association with the [[United States]], through the [[ANZUS|ANZUS pact]] and by a desire to develop relationships with [[Asia]] and the Pacific, particularly through [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]. In 2005 Australia secured an inaugural seat at the [[East Asia Summit]] following its accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. Australia is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], in which the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government]] meetings provide the main forum for co-operation. Much of Australia's diplomatic energy is focused on international trade liberalisation. Australia led the formation of the [[Cairns Group]] and [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], and is a member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and the [[WTO]]. Australia has pursued several major bilateral free trade agreements, most recently the [[Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement|Australia-US Free Trade Agreement]]. Australia is a founding member of the [[United Nations]], and maintains an international aid program under which some 60 countries receive assistance. The 2005–06 budget provides A$2.5&amp;nbsp;bn for development assistance;{{ref|AGov2005}} as a percentage of GDP, this contribution is less than that of the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. 

Australia's armed forces — the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) — comprise the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN), the [[Australian Army]], and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). All branches of the ADF have been involved in UN and regional peacekeeping (most recently in East Timor, the Solomon Islands and [[Sudan]]), disaster relief, and armed conflict, including the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. The government appoints the chief of the Defence Force from one of the armed services; the current chief is Air Chief Marshal [[Angus Houston]]. In 2005–06, the defence budget is A$17.5&amp;nbsp;bn.{{ref_label|AGov2005|8|a}}

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Australia}}
[[Image:Australia-climate-map_MJC01.png|thumb|250px|Climate map of Australia]]
Australia's 7,686,850 [[square kilometre]]s (2,967,909 [[square mile|sq.&amp;nbsp;mi]]) landmass is on the [[Indo-Australian Plate]]. Surrounded by the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]], [[Southern Ocean|Southern]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans, Australia is separated from Asia by the [[Arafura Sea|Arafura]] and [[Timor Sea|Timor]] seas. Australia has a total 25,760 [[kilometre]]s (16,007&amp;nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) of coastline and claims an extensive [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of 8,148,250 square kilometres (3,146,057&amp;nbsp;sq.&amp;nbsp;mi). This exclusive economic zone does not include the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]. 

The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef, lies a short distance off the north-east coast and extends for over 2,000 kilometres (1,250&amp;nbsp;mi). The world's two largest monoliths are located in Australia, Mount Augustus in Western Australia is the largest and Uluru in central Australia is the second largest. At 2,228 [[metre]]s (7,310 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), Mount Kosciuszko on the Great Dividing Range is the highest mountain on the Australian mainland, although Mawson Peak on the remote Australian territory of Heard Island is taller at 2,745 metres (9,006&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]).

==Climate==
The largest part of Australia is [[desert]] or [[semi-arid]] – 40% of the landmass is covered by [[sand dune]]s. Only the south-east and south-west corners have a temperate climate and moderately fertile soil. The northern part of the country has a tropical climate: part is tropical [[rainforest]]s, part grasslands, and very little desert. Australia receives [[snowfall]] in some cities, but mostly in towns and at higher evaluations. Climate is highly influenced by ocean currents, including the [[El Niño]] southern oscillation, which is correlated with periodic drought, and the seasonal tropical low pressure system that produces cyclones in northern Australia. Rainfall is highly variable, with frequent [[drought]]s. Rising levels of [[salinity]] and desertification in some areas. 

Australia is situated in the middle of the tectonic plate, and therefore has no active volcanism only extinct volcanos, although it may sometimes receive minor earthquakes. The terrain is mostly heavily weathered, low [[plateau]] with deserts, rangelands and a fertile plain in southeast.  Tasmania and the [[Australian Alps]] do not contain any permanent [[icefield]]s or [[glacier]]s, although they may have existed in the past. The [[Great Barrier Reef]], by far the world's largest [[coral]] [[reef]], lies a short distance off the north-east coast. [[Mount Augustus National Park|Mount Augustus]], in [[Western Australia]], is the largest [[monolith]] in the world.

== Flora and fauna ==
{{main articles|[[Flora of Australia]] and [[Fauna of Australia]]}}
[[Image:Koala climbing tree.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The [[Koala]] and the ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' make an iconic pair of Australian flora and fauna.]]
Although most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, it covers a diverse range of habitats, from alpine heaths to tropical [[rainforest]]s. Because of the great age and consequent low levels of fertility of the continent, its extremely variable weather patterns and its long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia's [[biota (ecology)|biota]] is unique and [[biodiversity|diverse]]. About 85% of [[flowering plant]]s, 84% of [[mammal]]s, more than 45% of [[List of Australian birds|bird]]s, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish are [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]].{{ref|DEH}} Many of Australia's ecoregions, and the species within those regions, are threatened by human activities and [[Invasive species in Australia|introduced plant and animal species]]. The federal ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' is a legal framework used for the protection of threatened species. Numerous [[Protected areas of Australia|protected areas]] have been created to protect and preserve Australia's unique ecosystems, 64 wetlands are registered under the [[Ramsar Convention]], and 16 [[World Heritage Site]]s have been established. Australia was ranked 13th in the World on the 2005 [[Environmental Sustainability Index]].

Most Australian plant species are evergreen and many are adapted to fire and drought, including the [[Eucalyptus|eucalyptus]] and [[acacia]]s. Australia has a rich variety of endemic [[legume]] species that thrive in nutrient-poor soils because of their symbiosis with [[Rhizobia]] bacteria and [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal]] fungi. Well-known Australian fauna include [[monotreme]]s (the [[platypus]] and [[echidna]]); a host of [[marsupial]]s, including the [[koala]], [[kangaroo]], [[wombat]]; and birds such as the [[emu]], [[cockatoo]], and [[kookaburra]]. The [[dingo]] was introduced by Austronesian people that traded with Indigenous Australians around 4000 [[Common Era|BCE]]. Many plant and animal species became extinct soon after human settlement, including the [[Australian megafauna]]; many more have become extinct since European settlement, among them the [[Thylacine]] (Tasmanian Tiger).

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Australia}}
[[Image:Melbourne yarra afternoon.jpg|240px|thumb|right| [[Melbourne]]'s population is approximately 3.7 million, the second largest in Australia]]
Australia has a prosperous, Western-style [[mixed economy]], with a per capita [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] slightly higher than those of the UK, [[Germany]] and [[France]]. The country was ranked third in the [[United Nations]]' 2005 [[Human Development Index]] and sixth in ''[[The Economist]]'' worldwide quality-of-life index 2005. In recent years, the Australian economy has been resilient in the face of global economic downturn. Rising output in the domestic economy has been offsetting the global slump, and business and consumer confidence remains robust. Australia's emphasis on economic reform is often claimed to be key factor behind the economy's strength. In the 1980s, the Labor Party, led by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[Paul Keating]], started the process of economic reform by [[Floating exchange rate|floating]] the [[Australian dollar]] in 1983, and deregulating the financial system.{{ref|Macfarlane1998}} Since 1996, the Howard government has continued the process of micro-economic reform, including the partial deregulation of the labour market and the privatisation of state-owned businesses, most notably in the [[Communications in Australia|telecommunications]] industry.{{ref|Parham2002}} Substantial reform of the indirect tax system was implemented in July 2000 with the introduction of a 10% [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]], which has slightly reduced the heavy reliance on personal and company income tax that still characterises Australia's tax system.

The Australian economy has not suffered a [[recession]] since the early 1990s. As of January 2006, [[unemployment]] was 5.3% with 10,034,500 persons employed.{{ref|ABS6202}} The service sector of the economy, including tourism, education, and financial services, comprises 69% of GDP.{{ref|DFAT}} [[Agriculture in Australia|Agriculture]] and natural-resources represent only 3% and 5% of GDP, respectively, but contribute substantially to Australia's export performance. Australia's largest export markets include [[Japan]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], the United States, [[South Korea]] and New Zealand.{{ref|ABS2005}} Areas of concern to some economists include the chronically high [[current account deficit]] and also high levels of net foreign debt.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Australia}}
[[Image:Sydney_opera_house_and_skyline.jpg|thumb|259px|right|Most Australians live in urban areas; [[Sydney]] is the most populous city in Australia.]]

Most of the estimated 20.4 million Australians are descended from 19th- and 20th-century immigrants, the majority from [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. Australia's population has quadrupled since the end of World War I {{ref|ABS}}, spurred by an ambitious [[Immigration to Australia|immigration]] program. In 2001, the five largest groups of the 27.4% of Australians who were born overseas were from the United Kingdom, [[New Zealand]], [[Italy]], [[Vietnam]] and China.{{ref_label|ABS2005|13|a}} Following the abolition of the [[White Australia policy]] in [[1973]], numerous government initiatives have been established to encourage and promote racial harmony based on a policy of [[multiculturalism]]{{ref|DIMIA}}. Australia’s population has increased by about 60 times since European settlement.

The self-declared indigenous population — including Torres Strait Islanders, who are of Melanesian descent — was 410,003 (2.2% of the total population) in 2001, a significant increase from the 1977 census, which showed an indigenous population of 115,953.{{ref|ABS2001}} Indigenous Australians have higher rates of imprisonment and unemployment, lower levels of education and life expectancies for males and females that are 17 years lower than those of other Australians.{{ref_label|ABS2005|13|b}} Perceived racial inequality is an ongoing political and [[human rights in Australia|human rights]] issue for Australians.

In common with many other developed countries, Australia is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. A large number of Australians (759,849 for the period 2002&amp;ndash;03{{ref|PoA2005}}) live outside their home country. Australia has maintained one of the most active [[Immigration to Australia|immigration]] programs in the world to boost population growth. Most immigrants are skilled; the quota includes categories for family members and [[refugee]]s. 

[[English language|English]] is the [[official language]],{{ref|DIMIA2}} and is spoken and written in a distinct variety known as [[Australian English]]. According to the 2001 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for around 80% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (2.1%), [[Italian language|Italian]] (1.9%) and [[Greek language|Greek]] (1.4%). A considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are [[Multilingual|bilingual]]. It is believed that there were between 200 and 300 [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] at the time of first European contact.  Only about 70 of these languages have survived, and all but 20 of these are now [[endangered languages|endangered]]. An indigenous language remains the main language for about 50,000 (0.02%) people. Australia has a [[sign language]] known as [[Auslan]], which is the main language of about 6,500 [[deaf]] people.

Australia has no [[state religion]].  The 2001 census identified that 68% of Australians call themselves Christian: 27% identifying themselves as [[Roman Catholic Church in Australia|Roman Catholic]] and 21% as [[Anglican Church|Anglican]]. Australians that identify themselves as followers of non-Christian religions number 5%. A total of 16% were categorised as having &quot;No Religion&quot; (which includes non theistic beliefs such as [[secular humanism|Humanism]], [[atheism]], [[agnosticism]] and [[rationalism]]) and a further 12% declined to answer or did not give a response adequate for interpretation. As in many Western countries, the level of active participation in church worship is much lower than this; weekly attendance at church services is about 1.5 million, about 7.5% of the population.{{ref|NCLSattsurvey}}

School attendance is compulsory throughout Australia between the ages of 6&amp;ndash;15 years (16 years in South Australia and Tasmania), contributing to an adult literacy rate that is assumed to be 99%. Government grants have supported the establishment of Australia's 38 universities, and although several private universities have been established, the majority receive government funding. There is a state-based system of vocational training colleges, known as [[Technical and Further Education|TAFE Institutes]], and many trades conduct [[apprenticeship]]s for training new tradespeople. Approximately 58% of Australians between the ages of 25 and 64 have vocational or tertiary qualifications.{{ref_label|ABS2005|13|c}}

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Australia}}
[[Image:Golden Summer Eaglemont Arthur Streeton.jpg|right|thumb|240px|''Golden Summer, Eaglemont'' ([[Eaglemont, Victoria]]) by [[Arthur Streeton]] (1889) is an early example of the rich tradition of Australian [[landscape painting]].]]
The primary basis of Australian culture up until the mid-20th century was [[Anglo-Celtic]], although distinctive Australian features had been evolving from the environment and [[Australian Aborigine|indigenous]] culture. Over the past 50 years, Australian culture has been strongly influenced by American popular culture (particularly television and cinema), large-scale immigration from non-English-speaking countries, and Australia's Asian neighbours.  The vigour and originality of the arts in Australia—films, opera, music, painting, theater, dance, and crafts—are achieving international recognition.

Australia has a long history of visual arts, starting with the [[Cave painting|cave]] and bark paintings of its indigenous peoples. From the time of European settlement, a common theme in [[Art of Australia|Australian art]] has been the Australian landscape, seen in the works of [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Arthur Boyd]] and [[Albert Namatjira]], among others. The traditions of indigenous Australians are largely transmitted orally and are closely tied to ceremony and the telling of the stories of the [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Dreamtime]]. [[Australian Aboriginal music]], dance and [[Australian Aboriginal art|art]] have a palpable influence on contemporary Australian visual and performing arts. Australia has an active tradition of [[music]], [[ballet]] and [[theatre]]; many of its performing arts companies receive public funding through the federal government's [[The Australia Council|Australia Council]]. There is a [[Orchestra|symphony orchestra]] in each capital city, and a national [[opera]] company, [[Opera Australia]], first made prominent by the renowned diva [[Joan Sutherland|Dame Joan Sutherland]]; [[Music of Australia|Australian music]] includes classical, jazz, and many popular music genres.

[[Australian literature]] has also been influenced by the landscape; the works of writers such as [[Banjo Paterson]] and [[Henry Lawson]] captured the experience of the Australian bush. The character of colonial Australia, as embodied in early literature, resonates with modern Australia and its perceived emphasis on [[egalitarianism]], mateship, and anti-authoritarianism. In 1973, [[Patrick White]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the only Australian to have achieved this; he is recognised as one of the great English-language writers of the 20th century. [[Australian English]] is a major variety of the language; its grammar and spelling are largely based on those of British English, overlaid with a rich vernacular of unique lexical items and phrases, some of which have found their way into standard English.

Australia has two public broadcasters (the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]), three commercial [[television network]]s, three pay TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. [[Cinema of Australia|Australia's film industry]] has achieved critical and commercial successes. Each major city has daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, ''[[The Australian]]'' and ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]''. According to [[Reporters Without Borders]] in 2005, Australia is in 31st position on a list of countries ranked by [[freedom of the press|press freedom]], behind [[New Zealand]] (9th)  and the [[United Kingdom]] (28th) but ahead of the [[United States]]. This ranking is primarily due to the limited diversity of commercial media ownership in Australia. Most Australian [[Publishing|print media]] in particular is under the control of either [[News Corporation]] or [[John Fairfax Holdings]].
[[Image:Aussie rules wikipedia.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Australian rules football]] was developed in [[Melbourne]], Australia and is played at amateur and professional levels.]]

[[Sport in Australia|Sport]] is an important part of Australian culture, assisted by a climate that favours outdoor activities; 23.5% Australians over the age of 15 regularly participate in organised sporting activities{{ref_label|ABS2005|13|d}}. At an international level, Australia has particularly strong teams in [[cricket]], [[field hockey|hockey]], [[netball]], [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], and performs well in [[cycling]] and [[swimming]]. Australia has participated in every summer [[Olympic Games]] of the modern era, and every [[Commonwealth Games]]. Australia has hosted the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] Summer Olympics, and has ranked among the top five medal-takers since 2000. In [[2004]], it collected 49 Olympic medals (17 gold, 16 silver and 16 bronze). Australia has also hosted the [[1938 British Empire Games|1938]], [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1962]] and [[1982 Commonwealth Games|1982]] Commonwealth Games, and will host the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]]. [[Australian rules football]] is the most popular national sport; players gain some international prominence through [[International rules football|International Rules]] which is an annual meeting between the Australian code and Irish Gaelic Football. However, [[Rugby League]] is more popular than Australian Rules in New South Wales and Queensland. The [[Australian Open]] is one of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis tournaments, held in [[Melbourne]] each January. The F1 [[Australian Grand Prix]] is also held in Melbourne, usually towards the end of March each year. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and élite athletes is common in Australia. 

Televised sport is popular; some of the highest rating television programs include the summer Olympic Games and the grand finals of local and international football competitions.{{ref|AFC}}

'''American Samoa''' ([[Samoan language|Samoan]]: '''Amerika Samoa''') is an [[unorganized territory|unorganized]], [[incorporated territory|unincorporated territory]] of the [[United States]] located in the South [[Pacific Ocean]] southeast of the sovereign state of [[Samoa]].  The main (largest and most populous) island is [[Tutuila]], with the {{Unicode|[[Manua|Manu'a]]}} Islands, [[Rose Atoll]], and [[Swains Island]] also included in the territory. American Samoa is part of the Samoan Islands chain, located west of the [[Cook Islands]], north of [[Tonga]], and some 300 [[mile]]s (500 km) south of [[Tokelau]]. To the west are the islands of the [[Wallis and Futuna]] group.

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Samoa]], [[History of American Samoa]]''

Originally inhabited as early as [[1000 BC]], Samoa was not reached by [[Europe]]an explorers until the [[18th century]].

International rivalries in the latter half of the [[19th century]] were settled by an [[1899]] [[Treaty of Berlin, 1899|Treaty of Berlin]] in which [[Germany]] and the U.S. divided the Samoan [[archipelago]]. The U.S. formally occupied its portion—a smaller group of eastern islands with the noted harbor of [[Pago Pago, American Samoa|Pago Pago]]—the following year. The western islands are now the independent state of [[Samoa]]. 

After the U.S. took possession of American Samoa, the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] built a [[coal|coaling]] station on Pago Pago Bay for its Pacific Squadron and appointed a local Secretary. The navy secured a Deed of Cession of Tutuila in [[1900]] and a Deed of Cession of {{Unicode|[[Manua|Manuʻa]]}} in [[1904]]. The last sovereign of {{Unicode|Manuʻa}}, the {{Unicode|[[Tui Manua Elisala|Tui Manuʻa Elisala]]}}, was forced to sign a Deed of Cession of {{Unicode|Manuʻa}} following a series of US Naval trials, known as the &quot;Trial of the Ipu&quot;, in Pago Pago, {{Unicode|Taʻu}}, and aboard a Pacific Squadron gunboat.

During [[World War II]], U.S. Marines in American Samoa outnumbered the local population, having a huge cultural influence. After the war, Organic Act 4500, a U.S. [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of Interior]]-sponsored attempt to incorporate American Samoa, was defeated in Congress, primarily through the efforts of American Samoan chiefs, led by [[Tuiasosopo Mariota]].  These chiefs' efforts led to the creation of a local legislature, the American Samoa ''Fono,'' which meets in the village of [[Fagatogo]], the territory's ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' capital.  (See the Trivia section below for more information on Fagatogo.)

In time, the Navy-appointed governor was replaced by a locally elected one.  Although technically considered &quot;unorganized&quot; in that the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] has not passed an [[Organic Act]] for the territory, American Samoa is self-governing under a constitution that became effective on [[July 1]], [[1967]].  The U.S. Territory of American Samoa is on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], a listing which is disputed by territorial government officials.

==Administrative Divisions==
American Samoa is administratively divided into 3 [[district]]s and 2 &quot;unorganized&quot; islands. These districts are subdivided into 73 villages. 
Districts:
* Eastern 
* Western 
* Manu'a 

Unorganized Islands:
*[[Rose Atoll|Rose Island]]
*[[Swains Island|Swains Island]]

==Trivia==
* American Samoa is the location of [[Rose Atoll]], the southernmost point in the United States (if [[insular area]]s and territories are included); see [[Extreme Points of the United States|extreme points]] for more information).
* About 30 ethnic Samoans, many from American Samoa, currently play in the [[National Football League]]. A 2002 article from [http://espn.go.com/gen/s/2002/0527/1387626.html ESPN] estimated that a Samoan male (either an American Samoan, or a Samoan living in the 50 United States) is 40 times more likely to play in the NFL than a non-Samoan American. A number have also ventured into professional wrestling (see especially [[:Category:Anoai wrestling family|Anoai wrestling family]]).
* Persons born in American Samoa are United States [[nationality|national]]s, but not United States [[citizen]]s. This is the only circumstance under which an individual would be one and not the other.
* The [[American Samoa national soccer team]] holds an unwanted world record in international [[football (soccer)|soccer]]—the record defeat in an international match, a 31-0 crushing by [[Australia national football team|Australia]] on [[April 11]], [[2001]].
* Although many respected reference sources list the neighboring village of [[Pago Pago]] as the capital, [[Fagatogo]] is the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' (i.e., constitutionally designated; cf. Article 5, Section 9) seat of government.  Additionally, the governor's office is located in the village of Utulei, located on the opposite side of Fagatogo from Pago Pago.  The reason why many sources list Pago Pago is because the name Pago Pago, the most popular port of call in American Samoa, has become associated with the harbor itself; thus Pago Pago is now generally applied to the harbor area and the capital.  However, both the port itself and the legislature of American Samoa—known as the Fono—are located in Fagatogo, a village that is adjacent to (and for all practical purposes indistinguishable from) Pago Pago.  (Cf. Wikipedia entry for [[Pago Pago]].)
*In March of 1889, a [[Germany|German]] naval force shelled a village in [[Samoa]], and by doing so destroyed some [[United States|American]] property. Three American warships then entered the [[Samoan]] harbor and were prepared to fire on the three German warships found there. Before guns were fired, a hurricane blew up and sank all the ships, American and German. A compulsory [[armistice]] was called because of the lack of warships.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''astronomer''' or '''astrophysicist''' is a person whose area of interest is [[astronomy]] or [[astrophysics]].
[[Image:Johannes Helvelius.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Johannes Hevelius]] was famed for his work on [[sunspot]]s, and being the first to study the surface of the [[moon]].]]

Astronomy is generally thought to have begun in [[ancient history|ancient]] [[Babylon]] by the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Zoroastrian]] priests (the ''[[magi]]''). Recent studies of Babylonian records have shown them to be extremely accurate for the ancient night sky. Following the Babylonians, the [[Egypt]]ians also had an emphasis on observations of the sky.

Mixtures of religious interpretations of the sky and the development of complex models for applying these interpretations, led to a [[duality]] that we now identify as [[astrology]]. It is important to recognize that before about [[1750]], there was no distinction between [[astrology]] and [[astronomy]].

Astronomers, unlike most scientists, cannot interact with the objects that they study. They instead must resort to detailed [[observation]] in order to make discoveries. Generally, astronomers use [[telescope|telescopes]] or other imaging equipment to make such observations. The job itself is involved with travel to remote locations to study as well.

'''Amoeboids''' are [[cell (biology)|cell]]s that move or feed by means of temporary projections, called [[pseudopod]]s (false feet).  They have appeared in a number of different groups.  Some cells in multicellular animals may be amoeboid, for instance our [[white blood cell]]s, which consume pathogens.  Many [[protist]]s exist as individual amoeboid cells, or take such a form at some point in their life-cycle.  The most famous such organism is ''[[Amoeba|Amoeba proteus]]''; the name amoebae is variously used to describe its close relatives, other organisms similar to it, or the amoeboids in general.

Amoeboids may be divided into several morphological categories based on the form and structure of the pseudopods.  Those where the pseudopods are supported by regular arrays of [[microtubule]]s are called actinopods, and forms where they are not are called rhizopods, further divided into lobse, filose, and reticulose amoebae.  There is also a strange group of giant marine amoeboids, the [[xenophyophore]]s, that do not fall into any of these categories.

* Lobose pseudopods are blunt, and there may be one or several on a cell, which is usually divided into a layer of clear ectoplasm surrounding more granular endoplasm.  Most, including ''Amoeba'' itself, move by the body mass flowing into an anterior pseudopod.  The vast majority form a monophyletic group called the [[Amoebozoa]], which also includes most [[slime mould]]s.  A second group, the [[Percolozoa]], includes protists that can transform between amoeboid and [[flagellate]] forms.

* Filose pseudopods are narrow and tapering.  The vast majority of filose amoebae, including all those that produce shells, are placed within the [[Cercozoa]] together with various flagellates that tend to have amoeboid forms.  The naked filose amoebae comprise two other groups, the [[vampyrellid]]s and [[nucleariid]]s.  The latter appear to be close relatives of [[animal]]s and [[fungus|fungi]].

* Reticulose pseudopods are cytoplasmic strands that branch and merge to form a net.  They are found most notably among the [[Foraminifera]], a large group of marine protists that generally produce multi-chambered shells.  There are only a few sorts of naked reticulose amoeboids, notably the [[gymnophryid]]s, and their relationships are not certain.

* Actinopods are divided into the [[radiolaria]] and [[heliozoa]].  The radiolaria are mostly marine protists with complex internal skeletons, including central capsules that divide the cells into granular endoplasm and frothy ectoplasm that keeps them buoyant.  The heliozoa include both freshwater and marine forms that use their axopods to capture small prey, and only have simple scales or spines for skeletal elements.  Both groups appear to be [[polyphyletic]].

Traditionally the amoeboid protozoa are grouped together as the Sarcodina, variously ranked from class to phylum, with each of the above categories as a formal subtaxon.  However, since they are all based on form rather than phylogeny, newer systems generally separate some out or abandon them entirely.  Most amoeboids are now included in two major supergroups - the [[Amoebozoa]], including most lobose amoebae and slime moulds, and the [[Rhizaria]], including the Cercozoa, Foraminifera, radiolarian classes and certain heliozoa.  However, amoeboids have appeared separately in many other groups, including various different lines of algae not listed above.

[[Image:ascii_full.png|frame|There are 95 printable ASCII characters, numbered 32 to 126.]]
'''ASCII''' ('''''A'''merican '''S'''tandard '''C'''ode for '''I'''nformation '''I'''nterchange''), generally [[IPA for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|[&amp;#712;æski]}}, is a [[character encoding]] based on the [[English alphabet]]. ASCII codes represent [[character (computing)|text]] in [[computer]]s, [[telecommunications|communications]] equipment, and other devices that work with text. Most modern character encodings have a historical basis in ASCII.

ASCII was first published as a standard in 1967 and was last updated in 1986. It currently defines codes for 33 non-printing, mostly obsolete [[control character]]s that affect how text is processed, plus the following 95 printable characters (starting with the space character):

&lt;pre&gt;
 !&quot;#$%&amp;'()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?
@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_
`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~
&lt;/pre&gt;

Asteroid [[3568 ASCII]] is named after the character encoding.

==Overview==
Like other character representation computer [[code]]s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and the symbols/[[glyph]]s of a written language, thus allowing [[digital]] devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information. The ASCII character encoding&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization ([[December 1]], [[1975]]). &quot;[http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/ISO-IR/001.pdf The set of control characters for ISO 646]&quot;. ''Internet Assigned Numbers Authority Registry''. Alternate U.S. version: [http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/ISO-IR/006.pdf]. Accessed [[August 7]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— or a compatible extension (see below)&amp;nbsp;— is used on nearly all common computers, especially [[personal computer]]s and [[workstation]]s. The preferred [[MIME]] name for this encoding is &quot;US-ASCII&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ([[January 28]], [[2005]]). &quot;[http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets Character Sets]&quot;. Accessed [[August 7]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

ASCII is, strictly, a seven-[[bit]] code, meaning that it uses the bit patterns representable with seven binary digits (a range of 0 to 127 decimal) to represent character information. At the time ASCII was introduced, many computers dealt with eight-bit groups ([[byte]]s or, more specifically, [[octet (computing)|octet]]s) as the smallest unit of information; the eighth bit was commonly used as a [[parity bit]] for error checking on communication lines or other device-specific functions. Machines which did not use parity typically set the eighth bit to zero, though some systems such as [[Prime computer|Prime]] machines running [[PRIMOS]] set the eighth bit of ASCII characters to one.

ASCII only defines a relationship between specific characters and bit sequences; aside from reserving a few control codes for line-oriented formatting, it does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Such concepts are within the realm of other systems such as the [[markup language]]s.

==History==
ASCII developed from [[Telegraphy|telegraphic codes]] and first entered commercial use as a seven-bit teleprinter code promoted by [[AT&amp;T|Bell]] data services. The [[Bell System]] had previously planned to use a six-bit code, derived from [[Fieldata]], that added punctuation and lower-case letters to the earlier five-bit [[Baudot code|Baudot]] teleprinter code, but was persuaded instead to join the [[American National Standards Institute|ASA]] subcommittee that had started to develop ASCII. Baudot helped in the automation of sending and receiving telegraphic messages, and took many features from [[Morse code]]; however, unlike Morse code, Baudot used constant-length codes. Compared to earlier telegraph codes, the proposed Bell code and ASCII both underwent re-ordering for more convenient sorting (especially alphabetization) of lists, and added features for devices other than teleprinters. [[Bob Bemer]] introduced features such as the '[[escape sequence]]'.

The American Standards Association (ASA, later to become [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]) first published ASCII as a standard in 1963. ASCII-1963 lacked the lowercase letters, and had an up-arrow (&amp;#8593;) instead of the caret (^) and a left-arrow (&amp;#8592;) instead of the underscore (_). The 1967 version added the lowercase letters, changed the names of a few control characters and moved the two controls ACK and ESC from the lowercase letters area into the control codes area.

ASCII was subsequently updated and published as ANSI X3.4-1968, ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986.

Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII. These encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, even though ASCII is strictly defined only by the ASA/ANSI standards:

* The [[European Computer Manufacturers Association]] published editions of its ASCII clone, ECMA-6, in 1965, 1967, 1970, 1973, 1983, and 1991. The 1991 edition is the same as ANSI X3.4-1986.&lt;ref&gt;ECMA International (December 1991). [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-006.pdf Standard ECMA-6: 7-bit Coded Character Set, 6th edition.] Accessed [[December 17]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[International Organization for Standardization]] published its version, ISO 646 (later [[ISO/IEC 646]]) in 1967, 1972, 1983, and 1991. ISO 646:1972, in particular, established a set of country-specific versions with punctuation characters replaced with non-English letters. ISO/IEC 646:1991 International Reference Version is the same as ANSI X3.4-1986.
* The [[International Telecommunication Union]] published its version of ANSI X3.4-1986, [[ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector|ITU-T]] Recommendation T.50, in 1992. In the early 1970s, under the name CCITT, the same organization published a version as CCITT Recommendation V.3.
* [[DIN]] published a version of ASCII as DIN 66003 in 1974.
* The [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] published a version in 1969 as RFC 20, and established the Internet's standard version, based on ANSI X3.4-1986, with the publication of RFC 1345 in 1992.
* [[IBM]]'s version of ANSI X3.4-1986 is published in IBM technical literature as [[code page 367]].

ASCII has also become embedded in its probable replacement, [[Unicode]], as the 'lowest' 128 characters. Some observers consider ASCII the most &quot;successful&quot; software standard ever promulgated.

==ASCII control characters==
ASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0–31 decimal) for [[control character]]s: codes originally intended not to carry printable information, but rather to control devices (such as [[computer printer|printer]]s) that make use of ASCII. For example, character 10 represents the &quot;line feed&quot; function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 27 represents the &quot;escape&quot; key often found in the top left corner of common [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]s.

Code 127 (all seven bits on), another special character, equates to &quot;delete&quot; or &quot;rubout&quot;. Though its function resembles that of other control characters, the designers of ASCII used this pattern so that it could &quot;erase&quot; a section of [[punched tape|paper tape]] (a popular storage medium until the 1980s) by punching all possible holes at a particular character position, thus effectively replacing any previous information. Since Code 0 (null,all bits off) was also ignored it was possible to leave gaps and then make corrections by blanking characters before or after the gap and then entering new characters in the gap.

Many of the ASCII control codes serve (or served) to mark data packets, or to control a data transmission protocol (e.g. ENQuiry [effectively, &quot;any stations out there?&quot;], ACKnowledge, Negative AcKnowledge, Start Of Header, Start of TeXt, End of TeXt, etc). ESCape and SUBstitute permit a communications protocol to, for instance, mark binary data so that if it contains codes with the same pattern as a protocol character, the recipient will process the code as data.

The designers of ASCII intended the separator characters (&quot;Record Separator&quot;, etc.) for use with magnetic tape systems.

Two of the device control characters, commonly interpreted as [[XON]] and [[XOFF]], generally function as [[flow control]] characters to throttle data flow to a slow device (such as a printer) from a fast device (such as a computer) - so data does not overrun and get lost.

Early users of ASCII adopted some of the control codes to represent &quot;meta information&quot; such as end-of-line, start/end of a data element, and so on. These assignments often conflict, so part of the effort in converting data from one format to another involves making the correct meta information transformations. For example, the character(s) representing end-of-line (&quot;[[newline]]&quot;) in text data files/streams vary from [[operating system]] to operating system. When moving files from one system to another, the conversion process must recognize these characters as end-of-line markers and handle them appropriately.

Today, ASCII users use the control characters less and less—with the exception of &quot;carriage return&quot; and/or &quot;line feed&quot;.  Modern markup languages, modern communication protocols, the move from text-based to graphical devices, and the demise of teleprinters, punch-cards, and paper tapes have rendered most of the control characters obsolete.

# Printable Representation, the [[Unicode]] glyphs reserved for representing control characters when it is necessary to print or display them rather than have them perform their intended function.
# Control key Sequence, the traditional key sequences for inputting control characters.  The caret (^) represents the &quot;Control&quot; or &quot;Ctrl&quot; key that must be held down while pressing the second key in the sequence.  The caret-key representation is also used by some software to represent control characters.
# The Backspace character can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Backspace&quot;, &quot;Bksp&quot;, or ← key on some systems.
# The Delete character can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Delete&quot; or &quot;Del&quot; key.  It can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Backspace&quot;, &quot;Bksp&quot;, or ← key on some systems.
# The Escape character can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Escape&quot; or &quot;Esc&quot; key on some systems.
# The Carriage Return character can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Return&quot;, &quot;Ret&quot;, &quot;Enter&quot;, or ↵ key on most systems.
# The ambiguity surrounding the Backspace key comes from systems that translated the DEL control character into a BS (backspace) before transmitting it.  Some software was unable to process the character and would display &quot;^H&quot; instead.  &quot;^H&quot; persists in messages today as a deliberate humorous device, e.g. [[there's a sucker born every minute|&quot;there's a sucker^H^H^H^H^H^Hpotential customer born every minute&quot;]].  A less common variant of this involves the use of &quot;^W&quot;, which in some [[text editor|text editors]] means &quot;delete previous word&quot;. The example sentence would therefore also work as &quot;there's a sucker^W potential customer born every minute&quot;.

==ASCII printable characters==
Code 32, the [[Space (punctuation)|&quot;space&quot; character]], denotes the space between words, as produced by the large space-bar of a keyboard. Codes 33 to 126, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, punctuation marks, and a few miscellaneous symbols.

Seven-bit ASCII provided seven &quot;national&quot; characters and, if the combined hardware and software permit, can use overstrikes to simulate some additional international characters: in such a scenario a backspace can precede a [[grave accent]] (which the American and British standards, but only those standards, also call &quot;opening single quotation mark&quot;), a [[tilde]], or a breath mark (inverted [[vel]]).

==Structural features==
* The digits 0-9 are represented with their values in binary prefixed with 0011 (this means that [[Binary-coded decimal|bcd]]-ASCII is simply a matter of taking each bcd nibble separately and prefixing 0011 to it.
* Lowercase and uppercase letters only differ in bit pattern by a single bit simplifying case conversion to a range test (to avoid converting characters that are not letters) and a single [[bitwise operation]].

==Aliases for ASCII==
RFC 1345 (published in June 1992) and the [http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets IANA registry of character sets] (ongoing), both recognize the following case-insensitive aliases for ASCII as suitable for use on the Internet:

* ANSI_X3.4-1968 (canonical name)
* ANSI_X3.4-1986
* ASCII
* US-ASCII (preferred MIME name)
* us
* ISO646-US
* ISO_646.irv:1991
* iso-ir-6
* IBM367
* cp367
* csASCII

Of these, only the aliases &quot;US-ASCII&quot; and &quot;ASCII&quot; have achieved widespread use. One often finds them in the optional &quot;charset&quot; parameter in the Content-Type header of some [[MIME]] messages, in the equivalent &quot;meta&quot; element of some [[HTML]] documents, and in the encoding declaration part of the prolog of some [[XML]] documents.

==Variants of ASCII==
As computer technology spread throughout the world, different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ASCII in order to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as &quot;ASCII [[Extended ASCII|extensions]]&quot;, although some mis-apply that term to cover all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range.

[[ISO 646]] (1972), the first attempt to remedy the pro-English-language bias, created compatibility problems, since it remained a 7-bit character-set. It made no additional codes available, so it reassigned some in language-specific variants. It thus became impossible to know what character a code represented without knowing which variant to work with, and text-processing systems could generally cope with only one variant anyway.

Eventually, improved technology brought out-of-band means to represent the information formerly encoded in the eighth bit of each byte, freeing this bit to add another 128 additional character-codes for new assignments. For example, [[IBM]] developed 8-bit [[code page]]s, such as [[code page 437]], which replaced the control-characters with graphic symbols such as [[smiley]] faces, and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 bytes. Operating systems such as [[DOS]] supported these code-pages, and manufacturers of [[IBM PC]]s supported them in hardware.

Eight-bit standards such as [[ISO 8859|ISO/IEC 8859]] and [[Mac OS Roman]] developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact and just adding additional values above the 7-bit range. This enabled the representation of a broader range of languages, but these standards continued to suffer from incompatibilities and limitations. Still, [[ISO-8859-1]] its variant [[Windows-1252]] (often mislabeled as ISO-8859-1) and original 7-bit ASCII remain the most common character encodings in use today.

[[Unicode]] and the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) have a much wider array of characters, and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII basically uses 7-bit codes, Unicode and the UCS use relatively abstract &quot;code points&quot;: non-negative integer numbers that map, using different encoding forms and schemes, to sequences of one or more 8-bit bytes. To permit backward compatibility, Unicode and the UCS assign the first 128 code points to the same characters as ASCII. One can therefore think of ASCII as a 7-bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of Unicode and of the UCS. The popular [[UTF-8]] encoding-form prescribes the use of one to four 8-bit code values for each code point character, and equates exactly to ASCII for the code values below 128. Other encoding forms such as [[UTF-16]] resemble ASCII in how they represent the first 128 characters of Unicode, but tend to use 16 or 32 bits per character, so they require conversion for compatibility.

The [[blend (linguistics)|blend]] word ''ASCIIbetical'' has evolved to describe the [[collation]] of data in ASCII-code order rather than &quot;standard&quot; alphabetical order.&lt;ref&gt;Jargon File. [http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/ASCIIbetical-order.html ASCIIbetical]. Accessed [[December 17]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The abbreviation ASCIIZ or ASCIZ refers to a [[Character string (computer science)|null-terminated ASCII string]].

[[Image:Africa satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|280px|A satellite composite image of Africa]] 

'''Africa''' is the world's second-largest and second most populous [[continent]], after [[Asia]].  At about 30,370,000 [[square kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]] (11,730,000 [[square mile|sq mi]]) including its adjacent islands, it covers 5.9% of the [[Earth]]'s total surface area, and 20.3% of the total land area. With over 840,000,000 people (as of 2005) in 61 territories, it accounts for more than 12% of the world's [[human population]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:LocationAfrica.png|thumb|250px|World map showing Africa (geographically)]]
The name '''Africa''' came into Western use through the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who used the name ''Africa terra'' — &quot;land of the Afri&quot; (plural, or &quot;Afer&quot; singular) — for the northern part of the continent, as the [[Africa (province)|province of Africa]] with its capital [[Carthage]], corresponding to modern-day [[Tunisia]].

The Afri were a tribe — possibly [[Berber]] — who dwelt in [[North Africa]] in the Carthage area.  The origin of ''Afer'' may be connected with [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] ''`afar'', [[dust]] (also found in most other [[Semitic languages]]); some other etymologies that have been postulated for the ancient name 'Africa' that are much more debatable include:

:*the [[Latin]] word ''aprica'', meaning &quot;sunny&quot;; 

:*the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''aphrike'', meaning &quot;without cold&quot; (see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]). The historian [[Leo Africanus]] ([[1495]]-[[1554]]) attributed the origin to the Greek word ''phrike'' (φρίκη, meaning &quot;cold and horror&quot;), combined with the negating prefix a-, so meaning a land free of cold and horror. However, the change of sound from ''ph'' to ''f'' in Greek is datable to about the [[first century]], so this is unlikely to be the origin.

Ancient Africa extended into what is now known as Asia.  There was no line drawn between the two continents until the geographer [[Ptolemy]] ([[85]] - [[165]] AD), accepted [[Alexandria]] as [[Prime Meridian]] and made the [[Suez Canal|isthmus of Suez]] and the [[Red Sea]] the boundary between [[Asia]] and Africa. As [[Europe]]ans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of ''Africa'' expanded with their knowledge.

==Geography==
''Main article: [[Geography of Africa]]''

[[Image:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|250px|Africa in the [[Blue marble]] picture, with [[Antarctica]] to the south, and the [[Sahara]] and [[Arabian peninsula]] at the top of the globe]]

Africa is the largest of the three great southward projections from the main mass of the Earth's surface. It includes within its remarkably regular outline an area, of c. 30,360,288 [[square kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]] (11,722,173 [[square mile|mi&amp;sup2;]]), including the islands.

Separated from [[Europe]] by the [[Mediterranean Sea]], it is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the [[Suez Canal|Isthmus of Suez]] (transected by the Suez Canal), 130 km (80 miles) wide. ([[Geopolitical]]ly, [[Egypt]]'s [[Sinai Peninsula]] east of the Suez Canal is often considered part of Africa, as well.) From the most northerly point,  [[Cape Blanc]] (Ra’s al Abyad) in [[Tunisia]] (37&amp;deg;21&amp;prime; N), to the most southerly point, [[Cape Agulhas]] in [[South Africa]] (34&amp;deg;51&amp;prime;15&amp;Prime; S), is a distance approximately of 8,000 km (5,000 miles); from [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]], 17&amp;deg;33&amp;prime;22&amp;Prime; W, the westernmost point, to [[Ras Hafun]] in [[Somalia]], 51&amp;deg;27&amp;prime;52&amp;Prime; E, the most easterly projection, is a distance (also approximately) of 7,400 km (4,600 miles). The length of coast-line is 26,000 km (16,100 miles) and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is shown by the fact that Europe, which covers only [[1 E12 m²|9,700,000 km&amp;sup2;]] (3,760,000 square miles), has a coast-line of 32,000 km (19,800 miles).

The main structural lines of the continent show both the east-to-west direction characteristic, at least in the eastern hemisphere, of the more northern parts of the world, and the north-to-south direction seen in the southern peninsulas. Africa is thus composed of two segments at right angles, the northern running from east to west, the southern from north to south, the subordinate lines corresponding in the main to these two directions.

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Africa]]''
[[Image:Afryka 1890.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Map of Africa 1890]]

Africa is home to the [[cradle of Humankind|oldest inhabited territory]] on earth, with the [[human]] race [[mitochondrial Eve|originating]] from this continent. During the mid 20th century, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] discovered many [[fossil]]s and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago. Fossil remains of several species of early ape-like humans thought to have [[evolve]]d into modern day man, such as ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' ([[radiometrically dated]] to 3.9-3.0 million years [[Before_Christ|BC]]), ''[[Paranthropus boisei]]'' (2.3-1.4 million BC) and ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' (c. 600,000-1.9 million BC) has been discovered.

The [[Ishango Bone]], dated to c. 25,000 years ago, shows [[tally stick|tallies]] in [[mathematical notation]]. Throughout humanity's [[prehistory]], Africa (like all other continents) had no [[nation state]]s, and was instead inhabited by groups of [[hunter-gatherers]] such as the [[Khoi]] and [[San]] (formerly known as [[bushmen]]).
 
Around 3300 BC, the historical record opens in Africa with the rise of literacy in [[Egypt]], which continued with varying levels of influence over other areas until 343 BC. Other prominent [[civilization]]s include [[Ethiopia]], the [[Nubia]]n kingdom, [[Carthage]], the kingdoms of the [[Sahelian kingdom|Sahel]] ([[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Mali Empire|Mali]], and [[Songhai empire|Songhai]]) and [[Great Zimbabwe]].

In 1482, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] established the first of many trading stations along the Guinea coast at [[Elmina]]. The chief commodities dealt in were slaves, gold, ivory and spices. The European discovery of America in 1492 was followed by a great development of the [[slave trade]], which, before the Portuguese era, had been an overland trade almost exclusively, and never confined to any one continent.

But at the same time that slavery was ending in Europe, in the early 19th century the European [[Imperialism|imperial]] powers staged a massive &quot;[[scramble for Africa]]&quot; and occupied most of the continent, creating many [[colony|colonial]] nation states, and leaving only two independent nations: [[Liberia]], the Black American colony, and [[Ethiopia]]. This occupation continued until after the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]], when all colonial states gradually obtained formal independence.

Today, Africa is home to over 50 independent countries, all but 2 of which still have the [[border]]s drawn up during the era of European [[colonialism]].

==Politics==
[[Image:ColonialAfrica.png|frame|''Map showing European claimants to the African continent at the beginning of [[World War I]]'']]
===Precolonial Africa===
{{sect-stub}}
===Colonial Africa===
[[Colonialism]] had a destabilizing effect on what had been a number of ethnic groups that is still being felt in African politics. Prior to European influence, national borders were not much of a concern, with Africans generally following the practice of other areas of the world, such as the Arabian peninsula, where a group's territory was congruent with its military or trade influence. The European insistence of drawing borders around territories to isolate them from those of other colonial powers often had the effect of separating otherwise contiguous political groups, or forcing traditional enemies to live side by side with no buffer between them. For example, the [[Congo River]], although it appears to be a natural geographic boundary, had groups that otherwise shared a [[language]], [[culture]] or other similarity who resided on both sides. The division of the land between [[Belgium]] and [[France]] along the river isolated these groups from each other. Those who lived in Saharan or [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and traded across the continent for centuries often found themselves crossing &quot;borders&quot; that existed only on European maps.

In nations that had substantial European populations, for example [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]], systems of second-class citizenship were often set up in order to give Europeans [[political power]] far in excess of their numbers. However, the lines were not often drawn strictly across racial lines. In [[Liberia]], the citizens who were descendants of American slaves managed to have a political system for over 100 years that gave ex-slaves and natives to the area roughly equal [[legislative power]] despite the fact the ex-slaves were outnumbered ten to one in the general population. The inspiration for this system was the [[United States Senate]], which had balanced the power of free and slave states despite the much larger population of the former.

Europeans often changed the balance of power, created ethnic divides where they did not previously exist, and introduced a cultural dichotomy detrimental to the native inhabitants in the areas they controlled. For example, in what is now [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]], two ethnic groups [[Hutus]] and [[Tutsis]] had merged into one culture by the time Belgian colonists had taken control of the region in the 19th century. No longer divided by ethnicity as intermingling, inter-marriage, and merging of cultural practices over the centuries had long since erased visible signs of a culture divide, the Belgians instituted a policy of racial categorization, upon taking control of the region, as racial based categorization and philosophies was a fixture of the European culture of that time. The term [[Hutu]] originally referred to the agricultural-based Bantu speaking tribes that moved into present day Rwandan and Burundi from the West, and the term [[Tutsi]] referred to North Eastern cattle-based tribes that migrated into the region later. The terms to the indigenous peoples eventually came to describe a person's economic class. Those individuals who owned roughly 10 or more cattle were considered Tutsi, and those with fewer were considered Hutu, regardless of ancestral history. This was not a strict line but a general rule of thumb, and one could move from Hutu to Tutsi and vice versa.

The Belgians introduced a racialised system. Those individuals who had characteristics the Europeans admired - fairer skin, ample height, narrow noses, etc. - were given power amongst the colonized peoples. The Belgians determined these features were more ideally [[Hamitic]], Hamitic in turn being more ideally European and belonged to those people closest to Tutsi in ancestry. They instituted a policy of issuing identity cards based on this philosophy. Those closest to this ideal were proclaimed Tutsi and those not were proclaimed Hutu.

===Post-colonial Africa===
Since independence, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and [[authoritarianism]]. The vast majority of African nations are [[republic]]s that operate under some form of the [[presidential system]] of rule. Few nations in Africa have been able to sustain [[Democracy|democratic]] governments, instead cycling through a series of brutal [[Coup d'état|coup]]s and [[military dictatorship]]s.

A number of Africa's post-colonial political leaders were poorly educated and ignorant on matters of governance; great instability, however, was mainly the result of marginalization of other ethnic groups and graft under these leaders. 

As well, many used the positions of power to ignite ethnic conflicts that had been exacerbated, or even created, under colonial rule. In many countries, the [[Armed force|military]] was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order and ruled most nations in Africa during the [[1970s|70s]] and early [[1980s|80s]].

During the period from the early [[1960s]] to the late 1980s Africa had over 70 coups and 13 presidential [[assassination]]s.

[[Cold War]] conflicts between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] also played a role in the instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two [[superpower]]s. Many countries in [[Northern Africa]] received Soviet military aid, while many in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the [[United States]] and/or [[France]]. The 1970s saw an escalation as newly independent [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] aligned themselves with the [[Soviet Union]] and the West and [[South Africa]] sought to contain Soviet influence.

Border and territorial disputes have also been common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts. 

Failed government policies and political corruption have also resulted in many widespread [[famine]]s, and significant portions of Africa remain with distribution systems unable to disseminate enough food or water for the population to survive. The spread of [[disease]] is also rampant, especially the spread of the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV) and the associated [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS), which has become a deadly [[epidemic]] on the continent.

Despite numerous hardships, there have been some signs the continent has hope for the future. [[Democracy|Democratic government]]s seem to be spreading, though are not yet the majority (National Geographic claims 13 African nations can be considered truly democratic). As well, many nations have at least nominally recognized basic [[human right]]s for all [[citizen]]s, though in practice these are not always recognized, and have created reasonably independent [[judiciary|judiciaries]].

There are clear signs of increased networking among African organisations and states. In the civil war in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (former [[Zaire]]), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, about half-a-dozen neighbouring African countries got involved (see also [[Second Congo War]]). The death toll has been estimated by some to be 3.5 million since the conflict began in 1998. This might play a role similar to that of [[World War II]] for Europe, after which the people in the neighbouring countries decide to integrate their societies in such a way that war between them becomes as unthinkable as a war between, say, [[France]] and [[Germany]] would be today.

Political associations such as the [[African Union]] are also offering hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries.

Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often times as a 'side-effect' of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]].

===Modern Africa===
Most western countries place limitations on aid to African nations, especially the United States. These limitations are often used to control the governments of these African nations; as a result, these nations are turning to non-traditional sources of financial aid. [[China]] has increasingly provided financial aid to Africa in order to secure contracts on [[Natural resource|natural resources]], such as [[petroleum|oil]], [[gold]], and [[diamonds]]. There usually is no political prescription. Countries the Chinese are investing in include:
Central African Republic (plantations), Nigeria ([[petroleum|oil]] &amp; [[gas]]), Sierra Leone ([[tourism]]), Gabon ([[petroleum|oil]]), Congo-Brazzaville ([[petroleum|oil]] &amp; wood-industry), Congo ([[copper]] &amp; [[cobalt]]), Angola ([[railroad]]-system), Libya ([[petroleum|oil]]), Sudan ([[petroleum|oil]]), Uganda ([[coffee]] &amp; [[fishing]]-industry), Kenya ([[Telecommunication|communications]]-network), Rwanda (public works), Burundi ([[Nickel]]), Zimbabwe (infrastructure), South Africa ([[coal]] &amp; [[gold]]).

==Economy==
''Main article: [[Economy of Africa]]''

Africa is the world's poorest inhabited continent: the [[United Nation]]s' [http://hdr.undp.org/ Human Development Report] [[2003]] (of 175 countries) found that positions 151 ([[Gambia]]) to 175 ([[Sierra Leone]]) were taken up entirely by African nations.

It has had (and in some ways is still having) a shaky and uncertain transition from [[colonialism]], with increases in [[political corruption|corruption]] and [[despotism]] being major contributing factors to its poor economic situation. While rapid growth in [[China]] and now [[India]], and moderate growth in [[Latin America]], has lifted millions beyond subsistence living, Africa has gone backwards in terms of foreign [[trade]], [[investment]], and [[per capita]] [[income]]. This [[poverty]] has widespread effects, including lower [[life expectancy]], [[violence]], and [[instability]] - factors intertwined with the continent's poverty. 

Major economic successes are [[Botswana]] and [[South Africa]], which is developed to the extent that it has its own mature [[Johannesburg Stock Exchange|stock exchange]]. This is partly due to its wealth of [[natural resource]]s, being the world's leading producer of both [[gold]] and [[diamond]]s, and partly due to its well-established legal system. South Africa also has access to financial capital, numerous markets and skilled labor. Other African countries are making comparable progress, such as [[Ghana]], and some, like Egypt, have a longer history of commercial and economic success.

[[Nigeria]] sits on one of the largest proven oil reserves in the world and has the highest population among nations in Africa, with one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. It is believed that with the country's rapidly expanding economy and increasing actions against corruption, Nigeria's status as Africa's economic powerhouse will soon be firmly established.

==Demographics==
Africans may be grouped according to whether they live north or south of the [[Sahara Desert]]; these groups are called [[North African]]s and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]ns, respectively. [[Afro-Asiatic]] speaking peoples predominate in North Africa, while Sub-Saharan Africa is dominated by a number of populations grouped according to their language --[[Niger-Congo]] predominantly in West Africa, [[Nilo-Saharan]] in the Eastern highlands and [[Khoisan]] in the south.

Speakers of [[Bantu languages]] (part of the Niger-Congo family) are the majority in southern, central and east Africa proper; but there are also several Nilotic groups in East Africa, and a few remaining [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous]] Khoisan ('[[San]]' or '[[Bushmen]]') and Pygmy peoples in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon and southern Somalia. In the [[Kalahari Desert]] of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also &quot;San&quot;, closely related to, but distinct from &quot;[[Khoikhoi|Hottentots]]&quot;) have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. [[Pygmies]] are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.

The peoples of [[North Africa]] comprise two main groups; [[Berber]] and [[Arabic]]-speaking peoples in the west, and [[Demographics_of_Egypt#People|Egyptians]] in the east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century introduced the [[Arabic language]] and [[Islam]] to North Africa. The Semitic [[Phoenicia]]ns, and the European [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] settled in North Africa as well. Berbers still make up the majority in [[Morocco]], while they are a significant minority within [[Algeria]]. They are also present in [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]]. The [[Tuareg]] and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. [[Nubians]] are a [[Nilo-Saharan]]-speaking group (though many also speak Arabic), who developed an ancient civilization in Northeast Africa.

During the past century or so, small but economically important colonies of [[Demographics_of_Lebanon#The_Lebanese_Diaspora|Lebanese]] and [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] have also developed in the larger coastal cities of [[West Africa|West]] and [[East Africa]], respectively.

Some [[Ethiopia]]n and Eritrean groups (like the [[Amhara]] and [[Tigray]]ans, collectively known as &quot;[[Habesha]]&quot;) have [[Semitic]] (Sabaean) ancestry. The Somalis as a people originated in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], but most Somali clans can trace some Arab ancestry as well. [[Sudan]] and [[Mauritania]] are divided between a mostly Arabized north and a native African south (although the &quot;Arabs&quot; of Sudan clearly have a predominantly native African ancestry themselves). Some areas of East Africa, particularly the island of [[Zanzibar]] and the Kenyan island of Lamu, received Arab Muslim and [[Southwest Asia]]n settlers and merchants throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and in antiquity.

Beginning in the [[16th century]], Europeans such as the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] began to establish [[trading post]]s and [[Fortification|forts]] along the coasts of western and southern Africa. Eventually, a large number of Dutch, augmented by French [[Huguenots]] and [[German people|Germans]] settled in what is today [[South Africa]]. Their descendants, the [[Afrikaners]] and the [[Coloureds]], are the largest European-descended groups in Africa today. In the [[19th century]], a second phase of colonization brought a large number of French and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] settlers to Africa. The Portuguese settled mainly in Angola, but also in Mozambique. The French settled in large numbers in [[Algeria]] where they became known collectively as ''[[Pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]'', and on a smaller scale in other areas of North and West Africa as well as in Madagascar. The British settled chiefly in South Africa as well as the colony of [[Rhodesia]], and in the highlands of what is now [[Kenya]]. Germans settled in what is now [[Tanzania]] and [[Namibia]], and there is still a population of German-speaking white Namibians. Smaller numbers of European soldiers, businessmen, and officials also established themselves in administrative centers such as [[Nairobi]] and [[Dakar]]. Decolonization during the 1960s often resulted in the mass emigration of European-descended settlers out of Africa &amp;mdash; especially from Algeria, Angola, Kenya and Rhodesia (now [[Zimbabwe]]). However, in South Africa and Namibia, the white minority remained politically dominant after independence from Europe, and a significant population of white Africans remained in these two countries even after [[liberal democracy|democracy]] was finally instituted at the end of the [[Cold War]]. South Africa has also become the preferred destination of white Anglo-Zimbabweans, and of migrants from all over southern Africa.

European colonization also brought sizeable groups of [[Asians]], particularly people from the [[Indian subcontinent]], to British colonies. Large [[Indian diaspora|Indian communities]] are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and east African countries. A fairly large Indian community in [[Uganda]] was expelled by the dictator [[Idi Amin]] in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the [[Indian Ocean]] are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The [[Malagasy]] people of [[Madagascar]] are a [[Malay people]], but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as [[Coloureds]] (people with origins in two or more races and continents).

==Languages==

''Main article: [[African languages]]''

By most estimates Africa contains well over a thousand [[language]]s. There are four major [[language family|language families]] native to Africa.

* The [[Afro-Asiatic languages|''Afro-Asiatic'']] languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout North Africa, [[East Africa]], the Sahel, and [[Southwest Asia]].
* The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|''Nilo-Saharan'']] language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people. Nilo-Saharan languages are mainly spoken in [[Chad]], [[Sudan]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and northern [[Tanzania]].
* The [[Niger-Congo languages|''Niger-Congo'']] language family covers much of Sub-Saharan Africa and is probably the largest language family in the world in terms of different languages. A substantial number of them are the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] languages spoken in much of sub-Saharan Africa. 
* The [[Khoisan languages|''Khoisan'']] languages number about 50 and are spoken in Southern Africa by approximately 120 000 people. Many of the Khoisan languages are [[endangered language|endangered]]. The [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[Bushmen|San]] peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa. 

With a few notable exceptions in [[East Africa]], nearly all African countries have adopted [[official language]]s that originated outside the continent and spread through [[colonialism]] or [[human migration]]. For example, in numerous countries [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Afrikaans]] and [[Malagasy]] are other examples of originally non-African languages that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres.

==Culture==
Africa has a number of overlapping cultures. The most conventional distinction is that between sub-Saharan Africa and the northern countries from [[Egypt]] to [[Morocco]], who largely associate themselves with [[Arab]]ic culture. In this comparison, the nations to the south of the [[Sahara]] are considered to consist of many cultural areas, in particular that of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] linguistic group.

Divisions may also be made between [[Francophone Africa]] and the rest of Africa, in particular the former British colonies of [[southern Africa|southern]] and [[East Africa]]. Another cultural fault-line is that between those Africans living traditional lifestyles and those who are essentially modern. The traditionalists are sometimes subdivided into [[pastoralism|pastoralists]] and [[agriculture|agriculturalists]].

[[African art]] reflects the diversity of African cultures. The oldest existing art from Africa are 6000-year old carvings found in [[Niger]], while the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in [[Egypt]] was the world's tallest architectural accomplishment for four thousand years until the creation of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. The Ethiopian complex of [[monolithic church]]es at [[Lalibela]], of which the [[Church of St. George]] is representative, is regarded as another marvel of engineering.

The [[music of Africa]] is one of its most dynamic art forms. Egypt has long been a cultural focus of the Arab world, while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular west Africa, was transmitted through the [[Atlantic slave trade]] to modern [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], [[rap music|rap]], and [[rock and roll]]. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of [[soukous]], dominated by the [[music of the Democratic Republic of Congo]]. A recent development of the 21st century is the emergence of [[African hip hop]], in particular a form from [[Senegal]] is blended with traditional [[mbalax]]. Recently in South Africa, a form of music related to [[house music]] known under the name [[Kwaito]] has developed, although the country has been home to its own form of [[South African jazz]] for some time, while [[Afrikaans]] music is completely distinct and comprised mostly of traditional [[Boere musiek]], and forms of [[Folk music|Folk]] and [[Rock and roll|Rock]].

==Religion==
Africans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs, with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] being the most widespread. Approximately 40% of all Africans are Christians and another 40% Muslims. Roughly 20% of Africans primarily follow indigenous [[African religions]]. A small number of Africans also have beliefs [[African Jew|from the Judaic tradition]], such as the [[Beta Israel]] and [[Lemba]] tribes.

The indigenous African religions tend to revolve around [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]]. A common thread in traditional belief systems was the division of the [[spiritual world]] into &quot;helpful&quot; and &quot;harmful&quot;. Helpful [[Spiritual being|spirits]] are usually deemed to include ancestor spirits that help their descendants, and powerful spirits that protected entire communities from natural disaster or attacks from enemies; whereas harmful spirits include the [[soul]]s of murdered victims who were buried without the proper [[Funeral|funeral rites]], and spirits used by hostile spirit [[Medium (spirituality)|mediums]] to cause illness among their enemies. While the effect of these early forms of worship continues to have a profound influence, belief systems have evolved as they interact with other religions.

The formation of the [[Old Kingdom]] of [[Egypt]] in the [[third millennium BCE]] marked the first known complex religious system on the continent. Around the [[ninth century BCE]], [[Carthage]] (in present-day [[Tunisia]]) was founded by the Phoenicians, and went on to become a major cosmopolitan center where [[deity|deities]] from neighboring Egypt, [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan city-states]] were worshipped.

The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] officially dates from the [[fourth century]], and is thus one of the first established [[Christianity|Christian]] churches anywhere. At first Christian Orthodoxy made gains in modern-day Sudan and other neighbouring regions; however following the spread of Islam, growth was slow and restricted to the highlands.

Islam entered Africa as Muslims conquered North Africa between 640 and 710, beginning with Egypt. They established Mogadishu, Melinde, Mombasa, Kilwa, and Sofala, following the sea trade down the coast of [[East Africa]], and diffusing through the Sahara desert into the interior of Africa -- following in particular the paths of Muslim traders. Muslims were also among the Asian peoples who later settled in British-ruled Africa.

Many Africans were converted to [[Western Christianity|West European forms of Christianity]] during the colonial period. In the last decades of the twentieth century, various sects of [[charismatic movement|Charismatic Christianity]] rapidly grew. A number of Roman Catholic African bishops were even mentioned as possible [[Pope|papal]] candidates in 2005. African Christians appear to be more socially conservative than their co-religionists in much of the industrialized world, which has quite recently led to tensions within [[Religious denomination|denominations]] such as the [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] and [[Methodism|Methodist Churches]].

&lt;br /&gt;[[Image:Animexample2.gif]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;''This animation moves at 2 frames per second.

&lt;/div&gt;

'''Animation''' is the illusion of motion created by the consecutive display of images of static elements. In film and video production, this refers to techniques by which each frame of a [[film]] or [[Film|movie]] is produced individually. These frames may be generated by computers, or by photographing a drawn or painted image, or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit (see [[claymation]] and [[stop motion]]), and then photographing the result with a special [[animation camera]]. When the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed, there is an illusion of continuous movement due to the phenomenon known as [[persistence of vision]]. Generating such a film tends to be very labour intensive and tedious, though the development of [[computer animation]] has greatly sped up the process.

[[Graphics file format]]s like [[GIF]], [[MNG]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]](SWF) allow animation to be viewed on a computer or over the Internet.

[[Image:Animexample3.png|frame|none|''The animations shown before consist of these 6 frames.'']]
__TOC__

== Animation techniques ==
[[Traditional animation]] began with each frame being painted and then filmed. [[Traditional animation|Cel animation]], developed by [[Bray Productions|Bray]] and Hurd in the 1910s, sped up the process by using transparent overlays so that characters could be moved without the need to repaint the background for every frame. More recently, styles of animation based on painting and drawing have evolved, such as the minimalist [[Simpsons]] cartoons, or the roughly sketched [[The Snowman]].

[[Computer animation]] has advanced rapidly, and is now approaching the point where movies can be created with characters so lifelike as to be hard to distinguish from real actors. This involved a move from 2D to 3D, the difference being that in 2D animation the effect of perspective is created artistically, but in 3D objects are modeled in an internal 3D representation within the computer, and are then 'lit' and 'shot' from chosen angles, just as in real life, before being 'rendered' to a 2D bitmapped frame. Predictions that famous dead actors might even be 'brought back to life' to play in new movies before long have led to speculation about the moral and copyright issues involved. The use of computer animation as a way of achieving the otherwise impossible in conventionally shot movies has led to the term &quot;[[computer generated imagery]]&quot; being used, though the term has become hard to distinguish from computer animation as it is now used in referring to 3D movies that are entirely animated.

Computer animation involves modelling, motion generation, followed by the addition of surfaces and then [[rendering]]. Surfaces are programmed to stretch and bend automatically in response to movements of a '[[wire frame model]]', and the final rendering converts such movements to a [[Raster graphics|bitmap image]]. It is the recent developments in rendering complex surfaces like fur and clothing textures that have enabled stunningly life-like character models, including surfaces that even ripple, fold and blow in the wind, with every fibre or hair individually calculated for rendering.  However, that actually has little to do with the animation itself.  Animation is the process of bringing a lifeless puppet to life through the use of motion.  Many people confuse fancy effects and high-res textures with animation, but in fact life-like motion can be created using the simplest of models.  Pixar's work is a testament to this.  The goal of an animator is not simply to &quot;copy&quot; the real world, but to enhance and to take the essence of the motion that is there, and this is how animation can be elevated to the level of art.

There is a large misconception in the public mind that computers create animation today.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  A computer is nothing more (though also nothing less) than a very expensive fancy pencil, and has to be treated as such for any quality work to be acheived.  The choices a computer makes when interpolating motion are almost always the wrong ones, because the computer does not know what you are trying to create.  Even if a complex physics system were created complete enough to exactly mimic the real world, the end result would not be the desirable one, because a large part of animation concerns the choices an animator makes.  When a computer tries to make the choices for you, disaster is the general result.

==History==
{{see|Animated cartoon|History of animation}}

The major use of animation has always been for entertainment. However, there is growing use of [[instructional animation]] and [[educational animation]] to support explanation and learning.

The &quot;classic&quot; form of animation, the &quot;[[animated cartoon]]&quot;, as developed in the early 1900s and refined by [[Ub Iwerks]], [[Walt Disney]] and others, requires up to 24 distinct drawings for one second of animation. This technique is described in detail in the article [[Traditional animation]].

Because animation is very time-consuming and often very expensive to produce, the majority of animation for [[Television|TV]] and movies comes from professional animation studios. However, the field of [[independent animation]] has existed at least since the [[1950s]], with animation being produced by independent studios (and sometimes by a single person). Several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry.  [[Bill Plympton]] is one of the most well known independent animators today.

[[Limited animation]] is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using &quot;short cuts&quot; in the animation process. This method was pioneered by [[United Productions of America|UPA]] and popularized (some say exploited) by [[Hanna-Barbera]], and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from [[movie theater]]s to [[television]].

==Animation studios==
Animation Studios, like [[Movie studio|Movie Studios]] may be production facilities, or financial entities. In some cases, especially in [[Anime]] they have things in common with [[Studio|artists studios]] where a Master or group of talented individuals oversee the work of lesser artists and crafts persons in realising their vision.

[[Image: Statue of Apollo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Statue of Apollo at the [[British Museum]].]]

In [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], '''Apollo''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: &amp;#913;&amp;#960;&amp;#972;&amp;#955;&amp;#955;&amp;#969;&amp;#957;, '''''Apóll&amp;#333;n'''''; or &amp;Alpha;&amp;pi;&amp;epsilon;&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;&amp;omega;&amp;nu;, ''Apell&amp;#333;n'') was a god of light, healing and poetry. Apollo was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin brother of [[Artemis]], goddess of the hunt. As the prophetic deity of the [[Delphic Sibyl|Delphic Oracle]], Apollo was one of the most important and many-sided of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian deities]]. In [[Etruscan mythology]], he was known as [[Aplu]].

In later times, Apollo became partly confused or equated with [[Helios]], [[solar deity|god of the sun]], and his sister similarly equated with [[Selene]], [[lunar deity|god of the moon]], particularly in religious contexts. However, Apollo and Helios remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts.

==Domains and symbols==
[[Image:Apollo II (Greek Mythology).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Apollo, the son of [[Zeus]] and the mortal [[Leto]].]]

Apollo was considered to have dominion over disease, beauty, light, healing, [[colony|colonists]], [[medicine]], [[archery]], [[poetry]], [[prophecy]], [[dance]], [[reason]], [[intellectualism]], and [[shaman]]s, and was the patron defender of herds and flocks.

Apollo's most common attributes were the lyre and the bow. Other attributes of his included the [[kithara]] (an advanced version of the common [[lyre]]) and [[plectrum]]. Another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod, representing his prophetic powers. The [[Pythian Games]] were held in Apollo's honor every four years at [[Delphi]]. The [[laurel tree|laurel]] bay plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games. The palm-tree was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in [[Delos]]. Animals sacred to Apollo included wolves, dolphins and roe, swans and grasshoppers (symbolizing music and song), hawks, ravens, crows and snakes (referencing Apollo's function as the god of prophecy), mice, and [[griffin]]s, mythical eagle-lion hybrids of Eastern origin.

As god of colonization, Apollo gave guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, [[750 BC|750&amp;ndash;550 BC]].  According to Greek tradition, he helped [[Crete|Cretan]] or [[Arcadia]]n colonists find the city of Troy. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts mention a Minor Asian god called ''Appaliunas'' or ''Apalunas'' in connection with the city of ''Wilusa'', which is now regarded as being identical with the Greek [[Troy|Illios]] by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo’s title of ''Lykegenes'' can simply be read as &quot;born in Lycia&quot;, which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a [[folk etymology]]).

Apollo popularly (e.g., in [[literary criticism]]) represents harmony, order, and reasons&amp;mdash;characteristics contrasted with those of [[Dionysus]], god of wine, who popularly represents emotion and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives ''[[Apollonian]]'' and ''[[Dionysian]]''. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for Hyperborea, he would leave the Delphi Oracle to Dionysus.

==Worship==
Apollo had a famous [[oracle]] in [[Delphi]], and other notable ones in [[Clarus]] and [[Branchidae]]. Apollo is known as the leader of the [[Muse]]s ('''''musagetes''''') and director of their choir. Hymns sung to Apollo were called [[Paean]]s.

The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks. There is a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the [[Roman Kingdom|kings]] during the reign of [[Tarquinius Superbus]]. In [[430]], a temple was dedicated to Apollo on the occasion of a pestilence. During the [[Second Punic War]] in [[212]], the Ludi Apollinares were instituted in his honor. In the time of [[Augustus]], who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, His worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome. After the [[battle of Actium]], Augustus enlarged his old temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted quinquennial games in his honour. He also erected a new temple on the Palatine hill and transferred the secular games, for which Horace composed his ''Carmen Saeculare'', to Apollo and [[Diana]].

The chief festivals held in honour of Apollo were the [[Carneia]], [[Daphnephoria]], [[Delia]], [[Hyacinthia]], [[Pyanepsia]], [[Pythia]] and [[Thargelia]]. The [[Ludi Apollinares]] were solemn games held to honor him.

The worship of Apollo has returned with the rise of [[revivalism|revivalist]] [[Hellenic polytheism]], and the contemporary Pagan movement. One example of this revival is the group [http://winterscapes.com/kyklosapollon Kyklos Apollon]. Also, together with Athena, Apollo (under the name Phevos) was controversially designated as a mascot of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

==Etymology==
The name ''Apollo'' might have been derived from a Pre-Hellenic compound ''Apo-ollon'',{{fact}} likely related to an archaic verb ''Apo-ell-'' and literally meaning &quot;he who elbows off&quot;, that is &quot;the Dispelling One.&quot; Indeed, he seems to have personified dispelling power, which would relate to his association with the darkness-dispelling power of the morning sun and  the conceived power of reason and prophecy to dispel doubt and ignorance. 
In addition:

* The apparent expelling character of city walls and doorways as bulwarks against trespassers
* The people-dispelling nature of disembarkations and [[expatriation]]s to colonies
* The disease-dispelling character of healing
* The predator-dispelling character of a shepherd tending his flocks
* The pest-dispelling nature of a farmer growing crops
* The power of music and the arts to dispel discord and [[barbary]]
* The highly important power of fit and skilled young men to dispel intruders and invading armies
* The ability of foresight into the future

An explanation given by [[Plutarch]] in ''[[Moralia]]'' is that Apollon signified a [[unity]], since ''pollon'' meant &quot;many,&quot; and the [[prefix]] ''a-'' was a negative. Thus, Apollon could be read as meaning &quot;deprived of multitude.&quot; Apollo was consequently associated with the [[monad]].

[[Hesychius]] connects the name Apollo with the Doric &amp;alpha;&amp;pi;&amp;epsilon;&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;&amp;alpha;, which means assembly, so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation &amp;sigma;&amp;eta;&amp;kappa;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (&quot;fold&quot;), in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.

[[Image:Apollonmosaic.jpg|thumb|366px|right|Apollo with a radiant [[halo]] in a Roman floor mosaic, [[El Djem]], Tunisia, lare 2nd century]]

== Apollo in art ==
In art, Apollo is usually depicted as a handsome beardless young man and often with a lyre or bow in hand. In the late 2nd century floor mosaic from [[El Djem]], Roman Thysdrus, (''illustration, right''), he is identifiable as [[Helios|Apollo Helios]] by his effulgent halo, though now even a god's divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later Empire. Anther haloed Apollo in mosaic, from Hadrumentum, is in the museum at Sousse [http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html].The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict [[Alexander the Great]] (Bieber 1964, Yalouris 1980).  Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ will be beardless and haloed.

== Appellations ==
[[Epithet]]s applied to Apollo include:
*'''Phoebus''' (&quot;shining one&quot;), for Apollo in the context of the god of light
*'''Smintheus''' (&quot;mouse-catcher&quot;) and '''Parnopius''' (&quot;grasshopper&quot;), as god of the plague and defender against rats and locusts.
*'''Delphinios''' (&quot;delphinian&quot;), meaning &quot;of the womb&quot;, associating Apollo with ''Delphoi'' ([[Delphi]]). An [[aitiology]] in the [[Homeric hymns]] connects the epitheton to [[dolphin]]s.
*'''Archegetes''', (&quot;director of the foundation&quot;) for colonies.
*'''Musagetes''' (&quot;leader of the [[muses]]&quot;).
*'''Pythios''' (&quot;Pythian&quot;) at [[Delphi]]
*'''Apotropaeus''' (&quot;he who averts evil&quot;)
*'''Nymphegetes''' (&quot;[[nymph]]-leader&quot;)
*'''Lyceios''' and '''Lykegenes''' (&quot;wolfish&quot; or &quot;of [[Lycia]],&quot; where some postulate his cult originated)
*'''Nomios''' (&quot;wandering&quot;), as the pastoral shepherd-god
*'''Klarios''' from Doric ''klaros'' &quot;allotment of land&quot;, for his supervision over cities and colonies.   
*'''Kynthios''' is another epithet, stemming from his birth on Mt. [[Cynthus]]
*'''Loxias''' (&quot;the obscure&quot;), as Apollo a god of prophecy specifically.
*'''Argurotoxos''', (&quot;with the silver bow&quot;) for archery.
*'''Aphetoros''', (&quot;god of the bow&quot;) for archery.
*'''Alexikakos''', (&quot;restrainer of evil&quot;), as Apollo the healer.
*'''Akesios''' or '''Iatros''', &quot;healer&quot;

== Birth ==

When [[Hera]] discovered that Leto was pregnant and that Hera's husband, Zeus, was the father, she banned Leto from giving birth on &quot;terra-firma&quot;, or the mainland, or any island at sea.  In her wanderings, Leto found the newly created floating island of [[Delos]], which was neither mainland nor a real island, and gave birth there.  The island was surrounded by swans.  Afterwards, Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean. This island later became sacred to Apollo.  Alternatively, Hera kidnapped [[Ilithyia]], the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor.  The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace, nine yards long, of amber.  Either way, Artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of Apollo.  Another version states that Artemis was born one day before Apollo, on the island of [[Ortygia]] and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo. Apollo was born on the 7th day (&amp;eta;&amp;#788;&amp;beta;&amp;delta;&amp;omicron;&amp;mu;&amp;alpha;&amp;gamma;&amp;epsilon;&amp;nu;&amp;eta;&amp;sigmaf;) of the month Thargelion according to Delian tradition or of the month Bysios according to Delphian tradition. The 7th and 20th, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.

== Youth ==
In his youth, Apollo killed the vicious dragon [[Python (mythology)|Python]], which lived in [[Delphi]] beside the [[Castalian Spring]], according to some because Python had attempted to rape Leto while she was pregnant with Apollo and Artemis.This was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the [[Oracle]] at Delphi to give her prophesies.  Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since Python was a child of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].

== Apollo and Admetus ==
When Zeus struck down Apollo's son, [[Asclepius]], with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead (and thus stealing [[Hades]]'s subjects), Apollo in revenge killed the [[Cyclops]], who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus. Apollo would have been banished to [[Tartarus]] forever, but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labour as punishment, thanks to the intercession of his mother, [[Leto]]. During this time he served as shepherd for [[Admetus|King Admetus]] of [[Pherae]] in [[Thessaly]]. Admetus treated Apollo well, and, in return, the god conferred great benefits on Admetus.

Apollo helped Admetus win [[Alcestis]], the daughtor of [[Pelias|King Pelias]] and later convinced the [[Moirae|Fates]] to let Admetus live past his time if another took his place. But when it came time for Admetus to die, his elderly parents, whom he had assumed would gladly die for him, refused to cooperate. Instead, Alcestis took his place, but [[Heracles]] managed to &quot;persuade&quot; [[Thanatos]], the god of death, to return her to the world of the living.

== Apollo during the [[Trojan War]] ==

Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment during the [[Trojan War]] in rage because the Greeks had kidnapped Chryseis, the daughter of Apollo's priest. He demanded her return, and the Greeks eventually complied.

When [[Diomedes]] injured [[Aeneas]] during the [[Trojan War]], Apollo rescued him.  First, [[Aphrodite]] tried to rescue Aeneas but Diomedes injured her as well.  Aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]], who took him to [[Pergamos (troy)|Pergamos]], a sacred spot in [[Troy]]. [[Artemis]] healed Aeneas there.

Apollo had aided Paris in the killing of [[Achilles]], if Paris did not accomplish the task himself.

== Niobe ==

A Queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]], [[Niobe]] boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two.  Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, with the last begging for his life, and Artemis her daughters.  Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions of the myth, a number of the Niobids were spared ([[Chloris]], usually).  Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.  A devastated Niobe fled to [[Mt. Siplyon]] in [[Asia Minor]] and turned into stone as she wept.  Her tears formed the river [[Achelous]].  Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.

== Apollo's romantic life and children ==

===Female lovers===
Apollo chased the nymph [[Daphne]], daughter of [[Peneus]], who had scorned him. His infatuation was caused by an arrow from [[Eros (god)|Eros]], who was jealous because Apollo had made fun of his archery skills.  Eros also claimed to be irritated by Apollo's singing. Simultaneously, however, Eros had shot a hate arrow into Daphne, causing her to be repulsed by Apollo. Following a spirited chase by Apollo, Daphne prayed to Mother earth (alternatively, her father- a river god) to help her and he changed her into a Laurel tree, which became sacred to Apollo.

Apollo had an affair with a mortal princess named [[Leucothea]], daughter of [[Orchamus]] and sister of [[Clytia]]. Leucothea loved Apollo who disguised himself as Leucothea's mother to gain entrance to her chambers. Clytia, jealous of her sister because she wanted Apollo for herself, told Orchamus the truth, betraying her sister's trust and confidence in her. Enraged, Orchamus ordered Leucothea to be buried alive. Apollo refused to forgive Clytia for betraying his beloved, and a grieving Clytia wilted and slowly died. Apollo changed her into an incense plant, either heliotrope or sunflower, which follows the sun every day.

[[Marpessa]] was kidnapped by [[Idas]] but was loved by Apollo as well.  [[Zeus]] made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.

[[Castalia]] was a [[nymph]] whom Apollo loved.  She fled from him and dived into the spring at Delphi, at the base of [[Mt. Parnassos]], which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire poets.

By [[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]], Apollo had a son named [[Aristaeus]], who became the patron god of cattle, [[fruit trees]], hunting, husbandry and [[bee-keeping]]. He was also a [[culture-hero]] and taught humanity dairy skills and the use of nets and traps in hunting, as well as how to cultivate olives.

With [[Hecuba]], wife of King [[Priam]] of [[Troy]], Apollo had a son named [[Troilius]].  An [[oracle]] prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilius reached the age of twenty alive.  He and his sister, [[Polyxena]] were ambushed and killed by [[Achilles]].

Apollo also fell in love with [[Cassandra]], daughter of Hecuba and Priam, and Troilius' half-sister.  He promised Cassandra the gift of prophecy to seduce her, but she rejected him afterwards.  Enraged, Apollo indeed gifted her with the ability to know the future, with a curse that no one would ever believe her.

[[Coronis]], daughter of [[Phlegyas]], King of the [[Lapiths]], was another of Apollo's liaisons.  Pregnant with [[Asclepius]], Coronis fell in love with [[Ischys]], son of [[Elatus]].  A crow informed Apollo of the affair. When first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black (where they were previously white) as a punishment for speading untruths. When he found out the truth he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis. As a result he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths. Apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] to raise. Phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Apollo then killed him for what he did.

===Male lovers===	
[[Image:Hyacinthus.jpg|thumb|250px|'''Apollo and Hyacinthus'''&lt;br&gt;Jacopo Caraglio; 16th c. Italian engraving]]

Apollo, the eternal beardless [[kouros]] himself, had the most male lovers of all the [[Greek gods]]. That was to be expected from a god who was god of the [[palaestra]], the athletic gathering place for youth who all competed [[Nudity in sport|in the nude]], a god said to represent the ideal educator and therefore the ideal [[erastes]], or lover of a boy (Sergent, p.102). All his lovers were younger than him, in the style of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek pederastic relationships]] of the time. Many of Apollo's young beloveds died &quot;accidentally&quot;, a reflection on the function of these myths as part of [[rite of passage|rites of passage]], in which the youth died in order to be reborn as an adult.	 

[[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]] was one of his male lovers. Hyacinthus was a [[Sparta|Spartan]] prince, beautiful and athletic. The pair were practicing throwing the [[discus]] when Hyacinthus was struck in the head by a discus blown off course by [[Zephyrus]], who was jealous of Apollo and loved Hyacinthus as well. When Hyacinthus died, Apollo is said in some accounts to have been so filled with grief that he cursed his own immortality, wishing to join his lover in mortal death. Out of the blood of his slain lover Apollo created the [[hyacinth (flower)|hyacinth flower]] as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with ''άί'' ''άί'', meaning alas. The Festival of Hyacinthus was a celebration of Sparta.

One of his other liaisons was with [[Acantha]], the spirit of the [[Acanthus (genus)|acanthus]] tree. Upon his death, he was transformed into a sun-loving herb by Apollo, and his bereaved sister, Acanthis, was turned into a thistle finch by the other gods.

Another male lover was [[Cyparissus]], a descendant of [[Heracles]]. Apollo gave the boy a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a [[javelin]] as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo turned the sad boy into a [[Cupressaceae|cypress]] tree, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.

== Apollo and the Birth of [[Hermes]] ==

Hermes was born on [[Mount Kyllini|Mount Cyllene]] in Arcadia. The story is told in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Hermes]]. His mother, [[Maia]], had been secretly impregnated by [[Zeus]], in a secret affair. Maia wrapped the infant in blankets but Hermes escaped while she was asleep. Hermes ran to [[Thessaly]], where Apollo was grazing his cattle. The infant Hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near [[Pylos]], covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a [[tortoise]] and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first [[lyre]]. Apollo complained to Maia that her son had stolen his cattle, but Hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in, so Maia refused to believe Apollo's claim. Zeus intervened and, claiming to have seen the events, sided with Apollo. Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo, a god of music, fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo became a master of the lyre and Hermes invented a kind of pipes-instrument called a [[syrinx]].

Later, Apollo exchanged a [[caduceus]] for a [[syrinx]] from Hermes.

== Other stories ==

=== Musical contests ===

==== [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] ====

Once Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo, and to challenge Apollo, the god of the [[lyre]], to a trial of skill.  [[Tmolus]], the mountain-god, was chosen to umpire.  Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, [[Midas]], who happened to be present.  Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre.  Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but Midas agreed with the judgment.  He dissented, and questioned the justice of the award.  Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a [[donkey]].

==== [[Marsyas]] ====
[[Image:The Flaying of Marsyas.jpg|thumb|230px|''The Flaying of Marsyas'' by [[Titian]], c.1570-76.]]
Marsyas was a [[satyr]] who challenged Apollo to a contest of music. He had found an [[aulos]] on the ground, tossed away after being invented by [[Athena]] because it made her cheeks puffy. Marsyas lost and was [[flaying|flayed]] alive in a cave near [[Calaenae]] in [[Phrygia]] for his [[hubris]] to challenge a god. His blood turned into the river Marsyas.

Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument (the lyre) upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument (the flute), and so Apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive. [taken from ''MAN MYTH &amp; MAGIC'' by Richard Cavendish]

=== Miscellaneous ===

When Zeus killed [[Asclepius]] for raising the dead and violating the natural order of things, Apollo killed the [[Cyclopes]] in response.  They had fashioned Zeus' thunderbolts, which he used to kill Apollo's son, Asclepius. As punishment, he was condemned by Zeus to year's servitude to King Admetus.

Apollo gave the order, through the Oracle at Delphi, for [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] to kill his mother, [[Clytemnestra]], and her lover, [[Aegisthus]].  Orestes was punished fiercely by the [[Erinyes]] for this crime.

In the [[Odyssey]], [[Odysseus]] and his surviving crew landed on an island sacred to Helios the sun god, where he kept sacred cattle. Though Odysseus warned his men not to (as [[Tiresias]] and [[kirke]] had told him), they killed and ate some of the cattle and Helios had [[Zeus]] destroy the ship and all the men save [[Odysseus]].

Apollo also had a [[lyre]]-playing contest with [[Cinyras]], his son, who committed suicide when he lost.

Apollo killed the [[Aloadae]] when they attempted to storm [[Mt. Olympus]].

It was also said that Apollo rode on the back of a swan to the land of the [[Hyperboreans]] during the winter months, a swan that he also lent to his beloved Hyacinthus to ride.

Apollo turned [[Cephissus]] into a [[sea monster]].

==Apollo in popular culture==
In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode &quot;[[Who Mourns for Adonis?]]&quot; a man claiming to be Apollo is seen on a [[Greek]]-themed planet that [[Captain Kirk]], [[Pavel Chekov]], [[Mr. Spock]], and [[Dr. McCoy]] arrive on.

In the ''[[Battlestar_Galactica|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series, one of the main characters is given the call-sign of Apollo.

The song &quot;[[Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres]]&quot; by [[Rush (band)|Rush]] is about the struggle between the champions of the two Hemispheres, Apollo, the God of Reason, and [[Dionysus]], the God of Love. The song appears of the [[1978]] album ''[[Hemispheres (1978 album)|Hemispheres]]''.

In the sixties, [[NASA]] named its [[Apollo program|Apollo Lunar program]] because Apollo was considered the god of all wisdom. Many people mistakenly believe that the rockets that carried astronauts to the Moon were called Apollo rockets; they were [[Saturn V]] rockets.

'''Andre Kirk Agassi''', (born [[April 29]] [[1970]], in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]) is a [[professional]] [[male]] former '''[[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|World No. 1]]''' [[tennis]] player from the [[United States]]. He has won eight [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles, and is one of only five players to have won all four Grand Slam events. He is considered among the all-time great tennis players. 

Agassi was married to the actress [[Brooke Shields]] from 1997 to 1999. Since 2001, he has been married to the former World No. 1 woman tennis player [[Steffi Graf]] and had two children.

==Early life==
Agassi's father, (an Armenian from Iran) Emmanuel &quot;Mike&quot; Agassian (who represented [[Iran]] in [[boxing]] at the 1948 and 1952 [[Olympic Games]] before emigrating to the [[United States]]), was intent on having a child win all four tennis Grand Slams. He called Agassi's two older siblings &quot;guinea pigs&quot; in the development of his coaching techniques. He honed Andre's eye-coordination when he was an infant by hanging tennis balls above his crib. He gave Agassi paddles and balloons when he was still in a high chair. When Agassi started playing tennis, his ball collection filled 60 garbage cans with 300 balls per can, and Agassi would hit 3,000-5,000 balls every day. When Andre was five years old, he was already practicing with pros such as [[Jimmy Connors]] and [[Roscoe Tanner]].

Mike Agassi learned tennis by watching tapes of champions. Mike Agassi took a very systematic approach to the physics and psychology of tennis, and still remains active in the sport. (More information can be found in Mike Agassi's book, ''The Agassi Story''.)

At age of 14, Andre was shipped off to teaching guru [[Nick Bollettieri]]'s Tennis Academy in [[Florida]]. He turned professional when he was 16.

==Tennis career==
===1986-1997===
Agassi turned professional in 1986, and won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at [[Itaparica]]. He won six further tournaments in 1988, and by December that year he had surpassed US$2 million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments – the quickest player in history to do so.

As a young up-and-coming player, Agassi embraced a rebel image. He grew his hair to rock-star length, sported an ear-ring, and wore colorful shirts that pushed tennis' still-strict sartorial boundaries. He boasted of a cheeseburger-heavy diet and endorsed the Canon Rebel camera. &quot;Image is everything&quot; was the ad's tag line, and it became Andre's as well.

Strong performances on the tour meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion. But he began the 1990s with a series of near-misses. He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the [[French Open]], where he lost in four sets to the seasoned veteran player [[Andrés Gómez]]. Later that year he lost in the final of the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]] to another up-and-coming teenaged star, [[Pete Sampras]]. The rivalry between these two American players was to become the dominant rivalry in tennis over the rest the of the decade. In 1991, Agassi reached his second consecutive French Open final where he faced his former Bollettieri Academy-mate [[Jim Courier]]. Courier emerged the victor in a dramatic rain-interrupted five-set final. 

Agassi chose not to play at [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] from 1988-90, and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event's traditionalism, particularly its &quot;predominantly-white&quot; dress code which players at the event are required to conform to. Many observers at the time speculated that Agassi's real motivation was that his strong baseline game would not be well suited to Wimbledon's [[grass court]] surface. Agassi decided to play at Wimbledon in 1991, leading to weeks of speculation in the media about what he would wear – he eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit. He reached the quarter-finals on that occasion. 

To the surprise of many, Agassi's Grand Slam breakthrough came at Wimbledon in 1992, when he beat [[Goran Ivanišević]] in a tight five-set final. 

Following wrist surgery in 1993, Agassi came back strongly in 1994 and captured the US Open, beating [[Michael Stich]] in the final. He then captured his first [[Australian Open]] title in 1995, beating Sampras in a four-set final. He won a career-high seven titles that year and he reached the World No. 1 ranking for the first time that April. He held it for 30 weeks on that occasion through to November. He compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer [[hardcourt]] circuit, which ended when he lost in the US Open final to Sampras. 

In 1995, Agassi won seven singles titles, the biggest being the [[Australian Open]], the [[Cincinnati Masters]], the [[Miami Masters]], and the [[Canada Masters]]. In terms of win/loss record, 1995 was Agassi's best year (72/10) (includes Davis Cup). This is slightly short of  Sampras's best season, 1994, in which he (Sampras) won 77 matches and lost 12. 
In 1996, Agassi won the men's singles Gold Medal at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], beating [[Sergi Bruguera]] of [[Spain]] in straight sets in the final. He also repeated at the [[Cincinnati Masters]] and the [[Miami Masters]].

1997 was a poor year for Agassi. He won no top-level titles and his ranking sank to World No. 141 in November. His form was perhaps affected by the intense publicity surrounding his high-profile and turbulent relationship and marriage to actress Brooke Shields.

===1998-2004===
In 1998, Agassi rededicated himself to tennis. He shaved his balding head, began a rigorous conditioning program, and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in Challenger Series tournaments (a circuit for professional players ranked outside the world's top 50). Perhaps most remarkably, the one-time rebel emerged as a gracious and thoughtful athlete, looked up to by younger players. After winning matches, he took to bowing and blowing a two-handed kisses to spectators on each side of the court, a gesture seen as a rather humble acknowledgment of their support for him and for tennis.

In 1998, Agassi won five titles and leapt from No. 122 on the rankings at the start of the year, to No. 6 at the end of it, making it the highest jump into the Top 10 made by any player in tennis. He won five titles in ten finals, and finished runner-up at the [[Miami Masters]]. 

Agassi entered the history books in 1999 when he beat [[Andrei Medvedev]] in a five-set French Open final to become only the fifth male player to have won all four Grand Slam singles titles (a feat last achieved in the 1960s by [[Roy Emerson]]). He followed this up by reaching the Wimbledon final, where he lost to Sampras. He then won the US Open, beating [[Todd Martin]] in five sets in the final, and finished the year ranked the World No. 1.

Agassi began 2000 by capturing his second Australian Open title, beating [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] in a four-set final. He was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand Slam finals since [[Rod Laver]] achieved the Grand Slam in 1969. 2000 also saw Agassi reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon, where he lost in five sets to [[Patrick Rafter]] in a very high quality battle considered by many to be one of the best matches ever played at Wimbledon [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742067.stm]. At the inaugural [[Tennis Masters Cup]] in [[Lisbon]], Agassi made it all the way to the final after defeating [[Marat Safin]] 6-3, 6-3 in the semifinals to end the Russian's hopes to become the youngest World No. 1 in the history of tennis.  Agassi eventually lost to [[Gustavo Kuerten]] 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. This loss allowed Kuerten to be crowned year end World No. 1. 2000 is considered by many of his fans to be a disappointing season for Agassi, as he managed to win only one tournament (2000 Australian Open).

Agassi opened 2001 by successfully defending his Australian Open title with a straight-sets final win over [[Arnaud Clement]]. At Wimbledon, he battled Rafter again in the semi-finals and lost 8-6 in the fifth set. At the US Open he lost in the quarter-finals to Sampras in what is considered to be one of tournament's all-time greatest matches. Sampras won 6-7, 7-6, 7-6, 7-6 in a match with no breaks of serve. 

Agassi and Sampras' last duel came in the final of the US Open in 2002. The battle between the two veterans saw Sampras emerge victorious in four sets, and left Sampras with a 20-14 edge in their 34 career meetings. (The match in fact proved to be the last of Sampras' career. He did not play in an event on the professional tour again, and officially announced his retirement in 2003.) Agassi's US Open finish, along with his victories at the Miami Masters, [[Rome Masters]], and [[Madrid Masters]], helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year-end No. 2 at 32 years and 8 months.

In 2003, Agassi won the eighth Grand Slam title of his career at the Australian Open, where he beat [[Rainer Schüttler]] in straight sets in the final. In May that year, he recaptured the World No.1 ranking to become the oldest No. 1 ranked male tennis player in history at 33 years and 13 days. He held the No. 1 ranking on that occasion for 13 weeks. At the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, he lost in the final to [[Roger Federer]] and finished the year ranked World No. 4.

In 2004, the 34-year-old Agassi won the [[Cincinnati Masters]] to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles and a record 17 ATP Masters Series titles. He became the second-oldest singles champion in Cincinnati's storied history (the tournament began in 1899), surpassed only by [[Ken Rosewall]] who won the title in 1970 at age 35.  

Agassi has also won one doubles title (at the [[Cincinnati Masters]] in 1993, partnering [[Petr Korda]]). He is one of only five male players to have won all the Grand Slams – along with legends [[Don Budge]], [[Roy Emerson]], [[Rod Laver]] and [[Fred Perry]]. He is in fact the first male tennis player to win the four Grand Slams on four different surfaces. The previous players won the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open on grass courts and the French Open on [[clay court]]s; whereas Agassi won the Australian Open on [[Rebound Ace]], the French Open on clay, Wimbledon on grass, and the US Open on hardcourts. After winning [[French Open]] in 1999, Agassi became the first male tennis player to win the [[Career Golden Slam]]. Agassi also helped the United States win the [[Davis Cup]] in 1990 and 1992. He was named the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality|BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]] in 1992. Agassi has earned more than US$30 million in prize-money throughout his career, second only to Sampras. In addition to this, he also earns over US$25 million a year through endorsements, the most by any tennis player and fourth in all sports (first place is [[Tiger Woods]] at US$70 million a year).

===2005===
Agassi started off 2005 with strong runs, most of which were cut short by [[Roger Federer]]. He lost to Federer in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open and the semifinals at Dubai. He reached the quarterfinals at Indian Wells after a dominant victory over Guillermo Coria, but withdrew from his match with Lleyton Hewitt with a swollen big toe. Agassi lost in the semifinals at Miami to Federer in a tight match. Although the claycourt season is the toughest on the body, Agassi played in Rome and reached the semifinals which he lost to Coria in a tough battle. At the 2005 French Open, Agassi lost to [[Jarkko Nieminem]], in their first-round match after enduring back pain related to a pinched [[sciatic nerve]]. He lost in five sets with 6-0 in the fifth. After much media speculation about retirement, the 35-year-old Agassi won in Los Angeles and made the final at Montreal before falling to world No. 2 [[Rafael Nadal]] in three long sets that he might have won if a few points had gone differently. His coach Darren Cahill and close friend and personal trainer [[Gil Reyes]] worked with Agassi throughout the summer to prepare for the [[2005 US Open]]. Agassi made a spectacular run at the Open, beating Razvan Sabau 6-3, 6-3, 6-1, [[Ivo Karlovic]] in the second round 7-6(7-4), 7-6(7-5), 7-6(7-4); [[Tomáš Berdych]] 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 7-6(7-2); and [[Xavier Malisse]] 6-3, 6-4, 6-7(5-7), 4-6, 6-2. His quarterfinal match against fellow American [[James Blake]] has been called one of the best matches in US Open history. After dropping the first two sets, 3-6, 3-6, Agassi took the next two, 6-3, 6-3. In the fifth set, Blake served for the match at 5-4, but Agassi broke his serve, then won the tiebreak 8-6 to secure the victory at 1:15 a.m. He defeated [[Robby Ginepri]], another rising, talented American with a consistent baseline game, in his third consecutive five-set match to earn a spot in the final against World No. 1 [[Roger Federer]]. After losing the first set 6-3, Agassi broke Federer twice to win the second, 6-2. He broke Federer again and at this point looked to be the better player. Agassi had a 30-love lead but with a few costly errors was broken to force a tiebreak, which Federer took, 7-1. Andre ran out of gas which allowed Federer to reel off five straight games.  Being down 5-0 in the fourth set, Agassi held to make it 5-1 before Federer closed it out to win the championship. After the match, Agassi thanked New York for the 20 years of memories, hinting at potential retirement. However, Agassi has made clear that he will only retire on his terms, when he feels that he cannot perform at his best on the court. He will likely continue for another year, as he has qualified for the 2005 Masters Cup (which is limited to the eight best players in the world) and is scheduled to play the lead-in tournament to the 2006 Australian Open.

Coming into the 2005 Masters Cup, Agassi is 29-5 on hard courts (with his only losses coming to [[Roger Federer]] and [[Rafael Nadal]]), and is 5-4 on clay (wins over Gasquet, Ljubicic, and Hrbaty, losses to Coria and Lopez).

In 2005, Agassi left [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] after 17 years and signed an endorsement deal with [[Adidas]]. [http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2116135]

Hampered by a third degree ankle injury caused by several torn ligaments, Agassi lost his opening match against Nikolay Davydenko in the Masters Cup and was forced to withdraw. The withdrawal list also included Rafael Nadal, Andy Roddick, Lleyton Hewitt, and Marat Safin.

===2006===

Agassi withdrew from the Australian Open because of an ankle injury. Once he withdrew, he immediately requested a wildcard to enter the Delray Beach International Tennis Championships, where he eventually finished as a quarterfinalist losing to [[Guillermo Garcia Lopez]] 4-6, 2-6. 
He was then forced to retire from SAP Open because of a lower back injury causing him severe pain in his lower back and down his legs. 
He then played in the Dubai Open where he won in straight sets over [[Greg Rusedski]] in the first round before losing in straights to German [[Bjorn Phau]] in second round.
Health permitting, Agassi is scheduled to play tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami to close out the winter hardcourt season. Agassi has officially said that he is skipping the entire clay season, since it burdens his body. He will do his best to be ready for Wimbledon. However, Agassi's top priority in 2006 will once again be making yet another run at the US Open in August. Expect all scheduling decisons to be made with that goal in mind.

==Playing style==
Agassi employs a baseline style of play, but unlike most such players, he typically makes contact with the ball ''inside'' the baseline -- exceptionally difficult even for professionals. This is possible because of his short backswing, which also helps him return fast serves. He is also blessed with the best hand and eye coordination, rivaled only by [[Roger Federer]].  [[John McEnroe]] and others have called Agassi the best service returner ever to play professional tennis.

After Agassi's rededication to tennis in 1998, he has focused more on physical conditioning than in the past and is now one of the fittest players on the tour. His upper-body strength allows him to [[bench press]] 350 lbs. He has remarkable endurance and rarely appears tired on court. As long as he is not injured, he handles long, grueling matches arguably better than any other player on the tour (even Roger Federer has been known to tire by the fifth set). Indeed, Agassi is often ready to start the next point when his opponent is catching his breath. One of his strategies is to wear down his opponents, continually putting pressure on them by returning the ball early and deep at angles. Agassi will try to stand in nearly one spot and hit the corners to make his opponent scramble. He will often pass up the winner and hit a slightly less aggressive shot to make his opponent run a little more to retrieve a few more shots. His penchant for running players around point after point has earned him the nickname &quot;The Punisher&quot;. 

Agassi's biggest weakness currently is his lack of consistent speed, and players who are able to consistently hit at sharp angles with pace give him trouble. Agassi used to be one of the fastest players on tour; however, his recent injuries have forced him to consistently run his fastest selectively, usually in Grand Slams and Tennis Masters Series events.  To make up for this recently-adopted weakness, Agassi generally keeps his opponent on the defense. (Federer is the only player with a long winning streak against Agassi; even Sampras lost to Agassi many times).

==Personal and family life==
After a four-year courtship, Agassi married actress Brooke Shields in a lavish ceremony on [[April 19]] 1997. That February, they had filed suit against ''[[The National Enquirer]]'' claiming it printed &quot;false and fabricated&quot; statements: Brooke was undergoing counseling, binge-eating and taking pills; Agassi &quot;lashed into&quot; Brooke and he and Brooke's mother &quot;tangled like wildcats&quot; when she demanded a [[prenuptial agreement|prenup]]; the case was dismissed. Agassi filed for divorce, which was granted on [[April 9]], 1999. 

By the time the divorce was final, Agassi was dating the German tennis legend Steffi Graf.  With only their mothers as witnesses, they were married at his home on [[October 22]], 2001. Their son, [[Jaden Gil Agassi|Jaden Gil]], was born 6 weeks prematurely on [[October 26]] that year. Their daughter, [[Jaz Elle Agassi|Jaz Elle]], was born on [[October 3]] [[2003]].

Agassi's older sister Rita married the former tennis legend [[Pancho Gonzales]]. In 1995, when Gonzales died in Las Vegas, Andre paid for his brother-in-law's funeral.

Andre has participated in many charity organizations, and founded the Andre Agassi Charitable Association, which assists the youth of Las Vegas. In 1995, he has won 1995's ATP Arthur Ashe's Humanitarian award in recognition of his efforts helping disadvantaged youth in LA. 

The Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation has always and will continue to fund organizations which offer programs that consistently carry out the mission of the Foundation. The Foundation's mission is to provide educational and recreational institutions and activities for abandoned, abused, and at-risk kids. The following organizations are fine examples:

===The Andre Agassi Boys &amp; Girls Club===
In 1997, Agassi opened the Boys &amp; Girls Club, a 25,000-square-foot facility that features an indoor basketball court, outdoor tennis courts, a computer lab, library and teen centre. It sees as many as 400 children a day in the summer and well over 2,000 during the year. 

Its junior tennis team, Team Agassi, includes mostly players with no previous tennis experience. As of January 2006, the team boasted four nationally ranked players as well as a number of regionally ranked players. Coached by Tim Blenkiron, the group practices regularly, attends study sessions, and often travels to play in various tournaments. The program also encourages members to respect each other and appreciate the challenges of winning and losing.

A basketball program, the Agassi Stars, began in 2000. Headed by Coach Jermone Riley, the Stars are required to attend study hall sessions, write to universities they might be interested in attending, and balance athletics and education.

The Foundation hopes to make these programs a college recruiting ground for kids with academic as well as athletic potential. In a community where drugs and gangs are prevalent forces, the Agassi Club promotes learning and gives kids a safe place to go after school.

== Ethnicity question ==
Agassi's ethnicity, beyond being an American citizen, has been a subject of discussion by fans around the world. His father Mike Agassi is of [[Armenian people|Armenian]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] ethnicity from the state of Iran, and there have been attempts to &quot;claim&quot; Agassi by both the Armenian and Iranian communities in the United States and abroad. Agassi has often seemed somewhat ambivalent, for example, joking after his &quot;All-Armenian&quot; match against [[Sargis Sargsian]] at the US Open in 2004, &quot;Well, I'm only half-Armenian&quot; [http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/tennis/articles/2004/09/07/armenian_supremacy_for_agassi?mode=PF], though he agreed to appear in a [[PBS]] documentary about [http://www.wliw.org/productions/armenian.html Armenian-Americans]. His father has written in his book, ''The Agassi Story'', about his experience of being an outsider in Muslim Iran, but Andre has also shown interest in the Iranian aspect of his heritage, in February 2005 expressing a desire to visit Iran, which holds &quot;a special place&quot; in his heart.[http://www.payvand.com/news/05/feb/1171.html]

==Quotes==
About Pete Sampras' retirement: &quot;You grow up with a guy, you compete against him for so long, he's such a big part of your career, something that's pretty special, so you do have that sense of personal regret that he's not around any more. You miss having that around.&quot;

During the 2005 US Open: &quot;I've been motivated by overcoming challenge and overcoming the hurdles and obstacles that face me. There still is plenty out there to get motivated by.&quot;

(from [[Mats Wilander]], asked to name the top 5 tennis players of all time; he placed Agassi, Sampras, Federer, and Borg in the top 4 (in no order) and tied McEnroe, Lendl, and Connors for fifth place): ON AGASSI: “He has some limitations, like he can’t serve and volley, yet he has won all four Slams. He has a very high energy level, quite like Borg. He is on fifth gear from the very first point. There is some abnormality in his eyes, otherwise he wouldn’t have had such a phenomenal return. He sees the ball like none else and just guides it wherever he wants to. He’s just played a Grand Slam final at 35, that tells me he wasted the first five years of his career, otherwise he couldn’t have lasted this long. No one has done more to tennis than Agassi and Borg.”

==Famous matches==
* US Open quarterfinal 1989: defeated [[Jimmy Connors]] 6-1, 4-6, 0-6, 6-3, 6-4. Agassi's first five-set win. At one point during a changeover, Agassi joked to his box that he was losing sets on purpose to prove that he could win in five. The previous time he played Connors was at the 1988 US Open quarterfinal in which he beat Connors convincingly and did not lose a set.
* French Open final 1990: lost to [[Andrés Gómez]] 6-3, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. Agassi's first Grand Slam final.

* French Open final 1991: lost to [[Jim Courier]] 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 1-6, 4-6. Blew 2 sets to 1 lead after rain delay. Many questioned if Agassi had the heart to win a major championship.

* French Open 1st round: lost to [[Marat Safin]] 7-5, 5-7, 2-6, 6-3, 2-6 in what was the Russian's first Grand Slam match. Safin's win foreshadowed his win over Pete Sampras in the 2000 US Open final.
* French Open final 1999: defeated [[Andrei Medvedev]] 1-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4.  A spectacular come-from-behind victory that completed his career Grand Slam at the &quot;advanced&quot; age of 29, and his return to the top of tennis after being as low as #141. Referred to as the &quot;Miracle in Paris&quot;. Agassi has stated that he considers this his greatest moment on a tennis court.
* US Open final 1999: defeated [[Todd Martin]] 6-4, 6-7(5), 6-7(2), 6-3, 6-2. Another come-from-behind thriller.
* Australian Open 2000 semi-final: defeated Pete Sampras 6-4, 3-6, 6-7(0), 7-6(5), 6-1. En route to his second Australian Open crown.  [[Tennis Magazine]] stated: &quot;''This'' was Sampras-Agassi for the ages.&quot;
* Wimbledon semi-final 2000: lost to [[Patrick Rafter]] 7-5, 4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3. This match was universally praised for its asthetic beauty as the world's greatest baseliner battled the game's most fluid and athletic volleyer over five tense sets.
* Australian Open 2001 semi-final: defeated Patrick Rafter 7-5, 2-6, 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-3. Exacted some revenge for 2000 Wimbledon semi loss to Rafter. Rallied from 2 sets to 1 down to stun Rafter in front of an energized Australian crowd.

* US Open 2001 quarter-final: lost to Pete Sampras 6-7(9), 7-6(2), 7-6(2), 7-6(5). Match featured no breaks of serve. Many consider this the best Agassi-Sampras match played.
* US Open 2002 final: lost to Pete Sampras 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. Sampras' final competitive match.
* French Open 2003 2nd round: defeated [[Mario Ancic]] 5-7, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2, 7-5. Rallied back from two sets to love against the young and powerful Ancic to win the match. One of only six matches Agassi has won after being down two sets to love. Three of them have been at the [[French Open]].
* French Open 2004 1st round: lost to [[Jerome Haehnel]] 4-6, 6-7(4), 3-6. Shock first round loss to lowly French career journeyman. Arguably the greatest upset in French Open history.
* US Open 2004 quarter-final: lost to Roger Federer 3-6, 6-2, 5-7, 6-3, 3-6. 5th set marred by record-breaking winds. By far Roger Federer's most difficult match en route to the title.
* Australian Open 2005 4th round: defeated [[Joachim Johansson]] 6-7(4), 7-6(5), 7-6(3), 6-4. Won despite Johansson's world-record 51 aces.
* French Open 2005 1st round: lost to [[Jarkko Nieminen]] 5-7, 6-4, 7-6, 1-6, 0-6.  Possibly Agassi's last match at the French Open.  He led two sets to one heading into the fourth set, but a pinched sciatic nerve hampered Agasi's movement very noticeably. Agassi limped off the court with tears in his eyes after the match. The match was a major indicator to many that Agassi's career might be coming to a close soon.
* US Open 2005 quarter-final: defeated [[James Blake]] 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 7-6(6). Agassi had never come back from two sets down in the US Open. This was called the best match of the 2005 Open and one of the best in US Open history.
* US Open 2005 semi-final: defeated [[Robby Ginepri]] in his third consecutive five-set thriller: 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. At 35 years old, he played his best tennis in the fifth set.
* US Open 2005, final: lost to Roger Federer in his sixth US Open final. In the finale of Agassi's magic run at the Open which included 3 five-set matches in a row, Agassi met Federer and appeared to have the upper hand, being up a break in the third set with the match tied at one set each.  However, Federer withstood the pressure and rallied to beat Agassi 6-3, 2-6, 7-6(1), 6-1.
* Tennis Masters Cup 2005, Round Robin: lost to [[Nikolay Davydenko]] 6-4, 6-2. Agassi was suffering from a sprained ankle injured while he was playing racquetball three weeks before. Although the match itself was unremarkable, the afterward was, when one of the tournament organizers absurdly accused Agassi of faking injury and losing on purpose because he (Agassi) was playing in Shanghai. It turned out that the same injury would cause Agassi to withdraw the 2006 Australian Open.

The '''Austro-Asiatic languages''' are a large [[language family]] of [[Southeast Asia]] and [[India]]. The name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for [[South Asia]]. Among these languages, only [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]], and [[Mon language|Mon]] have a long recorded history, and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status (in Vietnam and Cambodia, respectively). The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups. 

Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across India and Southeast Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken. It is widely believed that the Austroasiatic languages are the [[autochthonous]] languages of Southeast Asia and eastern India, and that the other languages of the region, including the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai]], and [[Sino-Tibetan]] languages, are the result of later [[human migration|migrations of people]]. (There are, for example, Austroasiatic words in the Tibeto-Burman languages of eastern Nepal.) Some linguists have attempted to prove that Austroasiatic languages are related to [[Austronesian languages]], thus forming the [[Austric languages|Austric]] superfamily.

Linguists traditionally recognize two major divisions of Austroasiatic, the [[Mon-Khmer]] languages of Southeast Asia and the [[Munda languages]] of east-central and central India. [[Ethnologue]] identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages, of which 147 are [[Mon-Khmer]] languages and 21 are [[Munda languages]]. However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published, and it remains speculative. 

Each of the subdivisions of the classification below that is written in boldface type is accepted as a valid family. However, the relationships between these families within Austroasiatic is debated. It should be noted that little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review. The classification used here is that of Diffloth (in press), which does not accept traditional Mon-Khmer as a valid unit.

[[Image:Afro-Asiatic.png|right|300px|thumb|Map showing the distribution of Afro-Asiatic languages]]
The '''Afro-Asiatic languages''' constitute a [[language family]] of about 240 languages and over 307 million people widespread throughout [[North Africa]], [[East Africa]], the [[Sahel]], and [[Southwest Asia]].  Other names sometimes given to this family include &quot;Afrasian&quot;, &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; (deprecated), &quot;Lisramic&quot; (Hodge 1972), &quot;Erythraean&quot; (Tucker 1966).

The following language subfamilies are included:

* [[Berber languages]]
* [[Chadic languages]]
* [[Egyptian language|Egyptian languages]]
* [[Semitic languages]]
* [[Cushitic languages]]
* [[Beja language]] (subclassification controversial; widely classified as part of Cushitic)
* [[Omotic languages]] (controversial; sometimes argued to be outside Afro-Asiatic)

The [[Ongota]] language is often considered Afro-Asiatic, but its classification within the family remains controversial, partly for lack of data. [[Harold Fleming]] tentatively suggests that it is an independent branch of non-Omotic Afro-Asiatic.

It is not generally agreed on where [[Proto-Afro-Asiatic]] was spoken; [[Africa]] (e.g., [[Igor Diakonoff]], [[Lionel Bender]]) has often been suggested, particularly [[Ethiopia]], because it includes the majority of the diversity of the Afro-Asiatic language family and has very diverse groups in close geographic proximity, often considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin. The western [[Red Sea]] coast and the [[Sahara]] have also been put forward (e.g., [[Christopher Ehret]]).  [[Alexander Militarev]] suggests that their homeland was in the [[Levant]] (specifically, he identifies them with the [[Natufian culture]]).

The Semitic languages are the only Afro-Asiatic subfamily based outside of Africa; however, in historical or near-historical times, some Semitic speakers crossed from South Arabia back into Ethiopia, so some modern Ethiopian languages (such as [[Amharic]]) are Semitic rather than belonging to the substrate Cushitic or Omotic groups.  (A minority of academics, e.g. A. Murtonen (1967), dispute this view, suggesting that Semitic may have originated in Ethiopia.)

[[Tonal language]]s are found in the Omotic, Chadic, and South &amp; East Cushitic branches of Afro-Asiatic, according to Ehret (1996). The Semitic, Berber and Egyptian branches are not tonal. 

==Common features and cognates==

Common features of the Afro-Asiatic languages include:
*a two-[[grammatical gender|gender]] system in the singular, with the feminine marked by the /t/ sound,
*[[Verb Subject Object|VSO]] [[linguistic_typology|typology]] with [[Subject Verb Object|SVO]] tendencies,
*a set of [[emphatic consonant]]s, variously realized as glottalized, pharyngealized, or implosive, and
*a templatic [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] in which words inflect by internal changes as well as prefixes and suffixes.


Some cognates are:
*''b-n-'' &quot;build&quot; (Ehret: *''b&amp;#301;n''), attested in Chadic, Semitic (''*bny''), Cushitic (*''m&amp;#301;n''/*''m&amp;#259;n'' &quot;house&quot;) and Omotic (Dime ''bin-'' &quot;build, create&quot;);
*''m-t'' &quot;die&quot; (Ehret: *''maaw''), attested in Chadic (eg Hausa ''mutu''), Egyptian (''mwt'', ''mt'', Coptic ''mu''), Berber (''mmet'', pr. ''yemmut''), Semitic (*''mwt''), and Cushitic (Proto-Somali *''umaaw''/*''-am-w(t)-'' &quot;die&quot;), also similar to the Latin ''mortis'', indicating a possible vocabulary drift
*''s-n'' &quot;know&quot;, attested in Chadic, Berber, and Egyptian;
*''l-s'' &quot;tongue&quot; (Ehret: ''*lis' ''&quot;to lick&quot;), attested in Semitic (*''lasaan/lisaan''), Egyptian (''ns'', Coptic ''las''), Berber (''ils''), Chadic (eg Hausa ''harshe''), and possibly Omotic (Dime ''lits'-'' &quot;lick&quot;);
*''s-m'' &quot;name&quot; (Ehret: *''s&amp;#365;m'' / *''s&amp;#301;m''), attested in Semitic (*''sm''), Berber (''ism''), Chadic (eg Hausa ''suna''), Cushitic, and Omotic (though the Berber form, ''ism'', and the Omotic form, ''sunts'', are sometimes argued to be Semitic [[loanword]]s.)  The Egyptian ''smi'' &quot;report, announce&quot; may also be cognate.
* ''d-m'' &quot;blood&quot; (Ehret: *''dîm'' / *''dâm''), attested in Berber (''idammen''), Semitic (*''dam''), Chadic, and arguably Omotic.  Cushitic *''dîm''/*''dâm'', &quot;red&quot;, may be cognate.


In the verbal system, Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (including Beja) all provide evidence for a prefix conjugation:
{|
|-
| English || Arabic (Semitic) || Kabyle (Berber)
| Saho (Cushitic; verb is &quot;kill&quot;) || Beja (verb is &quot;arrive&quot;)
|-
| he dies || ''yamuutu'' || ''yemmut''
| ''yagdifé'' || ''iktim''
|-
| she dies || ''tamuutu'' || ''temmut''
| ''yagdifé'' || ''tiktim''
|-
| they (m.) die || ''yamuutuuna'' || ''mmuten''
| ''yagdifín'' || ''iktimna''
|-
| you (m. sg.) die || ''tamuutu'' || ''temmuted&amp;#803;''
| ''tagdifé'' || ''tiktima''
|-
| you (m. pl.) die || ''tamuutuuna'' || ''temmutem''
| ''tagdifín'' || ''tiktimna''
|-
| I die || ''&amp;#704;amuutu'' || ''mmute&amp;#947;''
| ''agdifé'' || ''aktim''
|-
| we die || ''namuutu'' || ''nemmut'' || ''nagdifé'' || ''niktim''
|}

A causative affix ''s'' is widespread (found in all its subfamilies), but is also found in other groups, such as the [[Niger-Congo languages]].

The [[possessive pronoun]] suffixes are supported by Semitic, Berber, Cushitic (including Beja), and Chadic.

==Classification history==

Medieval scholars sometimes linked two or more branches of Afro-Asiatic together; already in the [[9th century]], the Hebrew grammarian [[Judah ibn Quraysh]] of [[Tiaret]], [[Algeria]] perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic (the latter being known to him through Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic.)

In the 1800's, Europeans began suggesting such relationships; thus in [[1844]] Th. Benfey suggested a language family containing Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter &quot;Ethiopic&quot;).  In the same year, T. N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.  The traditional &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; family was named by [[Friedrich Müller]] in [[1876]] in his ''Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft'', and defined as consisting of a Semitic group plus a &quot;Hamitic&quot; group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; the Chadic group was not included.  These classifications were partly based on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. (See also [[Hamitic hypothesis]].)

[[Leo Reinisch]] (1909) proposed to link Cushitic and Chadic, while urging a more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic, thus foreshadowing Greenberg; but his suggestion was largely ignored. [[Marcel Cohen]] (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct &quot;Hamitic&quot; subgroup, and included Hausa (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary.  [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1950) strongly confirmed Cohen's rejection of &quot;Hamitic&quot;, added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afro-Asiatic for the family; his classification of it came to be almost universally accepted.  In 1969, [[Harold Fleming]] proposed the recognition of [[Omotic]] as a fifth branch, rather than (as previously believed) a subgroup of Cushitic, and this has become generally accepted.  Several scholars, including Harold Fleming and [[Robert Hetzron]], have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic, but this view has yet to gain general acceptance.

There is little agreement on the subclassification of the five or six branches mentioned; however, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1979), [[Harold Fleming]] (1981), and [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1981) all agree that Omotic was the first branch to split from the rest. Otherwise, 
*Ehret groups Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic together in a North Afro-Asiatic subgroup; 
*[[Paul Newman (professor)|Paul Newman]] (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic; 
*Fleming (1981) divided non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or &quot;Erythraean&quot;, into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and Chadic-Berber-Egyptian; he later added Semitic and Beja to the latter, and proposed [[Ongota language|Ongotá]] as a tentative new third branch of Erythraean;  
*[[Lionel Bender]] (1997) advocates a &quot;Macro-Cushitic&quot; consisting of Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic, while regarding Chadic and Omotic as the most remote branches;
*[[Vladimir Orel]] and [[Olga Stolbova]] (1995) group Berber with Semitic, Chadic with Egyptian, and split Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afro-Asiatic, seeing Cushitic as a [[Sprachbund]] rather than a valid family;
*[[Alexander Militarev]] (2000), on the basis of [[lexicostatistics]], groups Berber with Chadic and both, more distantly, with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic.

The '''Principality of Andorra''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Principat d'Andorra'', [[French language|French]]: ''Principauté d'Andorre'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Principado de Andorra'') is a small, [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[principality]] in south-western [[Europe]], located in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountains and bordered by [[France]] and [[Spain]]. Once isolated, it is currently a prosperous country mainly because of [[tourism]] and its status as a [[tax haven]].  Andorra is not to be confused with the [[Andora|Comune di Andora]].

== Origin and history of the name ==

The name &quot;Andorra&quot; probably originates from a [[Navarre|Navarrese]] word ''andurrial'', which translates as ''shrub-covered land''.

== History ==
{{main|History of Andorra}}

Tradition holds that [[Charlemagne]] granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for their fighting the [[Moors]]. Overlordship of the territory passed to the local [[count of Urgell]] and eventually to the [[bishop]] of the [[diocese]] of Urgell. In the [[11th century]] a dispute arose between the bishop and his northern French neighbour over Andorra.

In 1278, the conflict was resolved by the signing of a [[parage]], which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the French [[count of Foix]] (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the bishop of [[La Seu d'Urgell]], in  [[Catalonia]]. This gave the small [[principality]] its territory and political form.

Over the years the title passed to the kings of [[Navarre]].  After Henry of Navarre became King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] of France, he issued an edict (1607) that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra.

In the period 1812–13, the French Empire annexed Catalonia and divided it in four departments. Andorra was also annexed and made part of the district of Puigcerdà (département of Sègre).

In 1933 France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections. On [[July 12]], [[1934]], an adventurer named [[Boris Skossyreff]] issued a proclamation in Urgel, declaring himself Boris I, sovereign prince of Andorra, simultaneously declaring war on the bishop of Urgel. He was arrested by Spanish authorities on [[July 20]] and ultimately expelled from Spain. From 1936 to 1940, a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and Franco's Spain.
The Franco troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war.

During the [[Second World War]], Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between [[Vichy France]] and Spain.

In 1958 Andorra declared peace with [[Germany]], having been forgotten on the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that ended the [[First World War]] and remaining legally at war.

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France and Spain. In recent times, however, its thriving [[tourism|tourist]] industry along with developments in transportation and communications have removed the country from its isolation and its political system was thoroughly modernized in 1993, the year in which it finally became a member of the United Nations.

== Politics ==
{{main articles|[[Politics of Andorra]] and [[Constitution of Andorra]]}}
{{seealso|List of Co-Princes of Andorra}}

Until very recently, Andorra's political system had no clear division of powers into [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislative]], and [[judicial]] branches. Ratified and approved in 1993, the [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]] establishes Andorra as a sovereign parliamentary democracy that retains the co-princes as [[head of state|heads of state]], but the [[head of government]] retains executive power. The two co-princes serve coequally with limited powers that do not include veto over government acts. They are represented in Andorra by a delegate.

The way in which the two [[prince]]s are chosen makes Andorra one of the most politically distinct nations on earth. One co-Prince is the man or woman who is currently serving as [[President of France]], currently [[Jacques Chirac]] (it has historically been any Head of State of France, including Kings and Emperors of France). The other is the current [[Catholic]] [[bishop]] of the [[Catalan]] city of [[La Seu d'Urgell]], currently [[Joan Enric Vives i Sicilia]]. As neither prince lives in Andorra their role is almost entirely ceremonial.

Andorra's main legislative body is the [[unicameral]] [[General Council of the Valleys]] (''Consell General de les Valls''), a [[parliament]] of 28 seats; members are elected by direct popular vote, 14 from a single national constituency and 14 to represent each of the 7 parishes, with members serving four-year terms. The Andorran government is formed by the General Council electing the [[Head of Government]] (''Cap de Govern''), who then appoints ministers to the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]], the Executive Council (''Govern''). Currently, government is held by the [[Liberal Party of Andorra]], with [[Albert Pintat]] as [[Prime Minister]]. The [[Social Democratic Party (Andorra)|Social Democratic Party]] is in opposition.

Defense of the country is the responsibility of [[France]] and [[Spain]].

== Administrative divisions ==
[[Image:Andorra.geohive.gif|thumb|right|300px|Map of Andorra.]]
{{main|Parishes of Andorra}}

Andorra consists of seven communities, known as ''parròquies'' (singular ''parròquia'' ''[[English Language|Engl.]]:'' parish)
*[[Andorra la Vella]]
*[[Canillo]]
*[[Encamp]]
*[[Escaldes-Engordany]]
*[[La Massana]]
*[[Ordino]]
*[[Sant Julià de Lòria]]

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Andorra}}

Befitting its location in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains of an average height of 1,996 m with the highest being the [[Coma Pedrosa]] at 2,946 m. These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the [[Valira]] river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorra's lowest point of 870 m).

Andorra's [[climate]] is similar to its neighbours' [[temperate climate]], but its higher altitude means there is on average more snow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Andorra}}

[[Image:AndorraLaVella.jpg|left|190px|Andorra La Vella]]
[[Tourism]], the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter [[resort]]s. Andorra's comparative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining [[France]] and [[Spain]] have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower [[tariff]]s.

The [[banking]] sector, with its [[tax haven]] status, also contributes substantially to the economy. [[Agriculture|Agricultural]] production is limited&amp;mdash;only 2% of the land is arable&amp;mdash;and most [[food]] has to be [[import]]ed. The principal livestock activity is [[domestic sheep]] raising. [[Manufacturing]] output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.

Andorra is not a full member of the [[European Union]], but enjoys a special relationship with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacks a [[currency]] of its own and uses that of its two surrounding nations. Prior to 1999 these were the [[French franc]] and the Spanish [[peseta]], which have since been replaced by a single currency, the [[euro]]. Unlike other small European states that use the euro, Andorra does not yet mint its own [[euro coins]]; in October 2004, negotiations between Andorra and the [[European Union|EU]] began on an agreement which would allow Andorra to mint its own coins. Andorra’s [[natural resource]]s include [[hydropower]], [[mineral water]], [[timber]], [[iron ore]], and [[lead]].

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Andorra}}
{{seealso|List of Andorrans}}

Andorrans constitute a minority in their own country; only 33% of inhabitants hold Andorran nationality. The largest group of foreign nationals is that of [[Spain|Spaniards]] (43%), with [[Portugal|Portuguese]] (11%) and [[France|French]] (7%) nationals the other main groups. The remaining 6% belong to several other nationalities.

The only official language is [[Catalan language|Catalan]], the language of the nearby Spanish [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous region]] of [[Catalonia]], with which Andorra shares many cultural traits, though [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]] and [[French language|French]] are also commonly spoken. The predominant religion is [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Andorra}}
{{seealso|Music of Andorra}}

Andorra's long [[history]] has provided it with a rich [[mythology]] and an abundance of [[Fable|folk tales]], with roots originating in as far as [[Andalusia]] in the south and [[Netherlands]] in the north.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], the '''arithmetic [[mean]]''' of a set of numbers is the sum of all the members of the set divided by the number of items in the set (cardinality). (The word ''set'' is used perhaps somewhat loosely; for example, the number 3.8 could occur more than once in such a &quot;set&quot;.) If one particular number occurs more times than others in the set, it is called a mode. The arithmetic mean is what pupils are taught very early to call the &quot;[[average]].&quot; If the set is a [[statistical population]], then we speak of the '''population mean'''. If the set is a [[sampling (statistics)|statistical sample]], we call the resulting [[statistic]] a '''sample mean'''.

When the mean is not an accurate estimate of the median, the set of numbers, or [[frequency distribution]], is said to be [[skewness|skewed]].

The symbol &amp;mu; (Greek: mu) is used to denote the arithmetic mean of a population.

If we denote a set of data by ''X'' = { ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}, then the sample mean is typically denoted with a horizontal bar over the variable (''x̅'', generally enunciated &quot;''x'' bar&quot;).

In practice, the difference between &amp;mu; and ''x̅'' is that &amp;mu; is typically unobservable because one observes only a sample rather than the whole population, and if the sample is drawn randomly, then one may treat ''x̅'', but not &amp;mu;, as a [[random variable]], attributing a [[probability distribution]] to it.

Both are computed in the same way:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{mean} = \bar{x} = (x_1+\cdots+x_n)/n.&lt;/math&gt;

The arithmetic mean is greatly influenced by [[outlier]]s. For instance, reporting the &quot;average&quot; [[net worth]] in [[Redmond, Washington]] as the arithmetic mean of all annual net worths would yield a surprisingly high number because of [[Bill Gates]]. These distortions occur when the mean is different from the median, and the median is a superior alternative when that happens.

In certain situations, the arithmetic mean is the wrong concept of &quot;average&quot; altogether. For example, if a stock rose 10% in the first year, 30% in the second year and fell 10% in the third year, then it would be incorrect to report its &quot;average&quot; increase per year over this three year period as the arithmetic mean (10% + 30% + (&amp;minus;10%))/3 = 10%; the correct average in this case is the [[geometric mean]] which yields an average increase per year of only 8.8%.

If ''X'' is a [[random variable]], then the [[expected value]] of ''X'' can be seen as the long-term arithmetic mean that occurs on repeated measurements of ''X''. This is the content of the [[law of large numbers]]. As a result, the sample mean is used to estimate unknown expected values.

Note that several other &quot;means&quot; have been defined, including the [[generalized mean]], the [[generalised f-mean|generalized f-mean]], the [[harmonic mean]], the [[arithmetic-geometric mean]], and the [[weighted mean]].

==Alternate notations==
The arithmetic mean may also be expressed using the sum notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n x_i.&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>briefly mention the NFC</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AmericanFootballConference.png|right|American Football Conference]]
The '''American Football Conference''' ('''AFC''') is one of the two conferences of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The AFC was created after the league [[AFL-NFL Merger|merged]] with the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in early 1970. The NFL's [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and the then-[[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] agreed to join the new AFC along with the 10 former AFL teams. All of the other NFL teams formed the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC). Initially, this alignment proved to be very unpopular with fans in these cities.

The AFC logo, shown to the right, is a variation of the old AFL logo [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:AmericanFootballLeague.jpg as seen here]. Introduced in 1970 alongside the beginning of the new AFC, the logo has basically remained unchanged since its introduction, though the &quot;A&quot; wasn't as bold when it was first introduced.

The AFC currently consists of 16 teams, organized into four divisions (North, South, East, and West) of four teams each. Each team plays the other teams in their division twice (home and away) during the regular season in addition to 10 other games/teams assigned to their schedule by the NFL the previous May.  Two of these games are assigned on the basis of the team's final record in the previous season.  The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions.  This assignment shifts each year.  For instance, in the [[2006 NFL season|2006 regular season]], each team in the [[AFC East]] will play a game apiece against each team in both the [[AFC South]] and the [[NFC North]].  In this way division competition consists of common opponents, with the exception of the 2 games assigned on the strength of each team's prior season record. The NFC operates according to the same system.

At the end of each football [[season (sport)|season]], there are [[NFL playoffs|playoff]] games involving the top six teams in the AFC (the four division champions by place standing and the top two remaining non-division-champion teams (&quot;[[Wild card (sports)|wild cards]]&quot;) by record). The last two teams remaining play in the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship game]] with the winner receiving the [[Lamar Hunt]] Trophy. The AFC champion plays the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] champion in the [[Super Bowl]].

'''Albert Arnold Gore, Jr.''' (born [[March 31]], [[1948]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] and businessman, who served as the 45th [[Vice President of the United States]] from [[1993]] to [[2001]].  

He [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|ran for President in 2000]] following [[Bill Clinton]]'s two four-year terms. He was defeated in the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]] vote by the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] candidate [[George W. Bush]] on a vote of 271-266 with a Gore committed Elector from [[Washington, DC]] abstaining. However, Gore did receive more individual votes than Bush. The election was bitterly contested, including multiple recounts and a [[Bush v. Gore|5-4 Supreme Court]] decision that effectively secured the election for President [[George W. Bush]]. 

Gore currently serves as President of the American television channel [[Current TV|Current]] and Chairman of [[Generation Investment Management]], sits on the board of directors of [[Apple Computer]], and serves as an unofficial advisor to [[Google]]'s senior management.
Although speculation about a possible [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|presidential run in 2008]] still continues, he has stated that he does not currently plan to return to politics, but doesn't rule this possibility out in the future.

==Early life==
He attended the [[Sheridan school|Sheridan School]], and later the elite [[St. Albans School]]. In 1965, Gore enrolled at [[Harvard College]], where he majored in government. His roommates (in [[Dunster House]]) were actor [[Tommy Lee Jones]] and former Columbia University women's basketball star Katie Day's father, Bart Day. Gore graduated from Harvard in June 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. 

:For more information on Gore's academic records, see [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;amp;contentId=A37397-2000Mar18]

==Family==
Al Gore was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], to [[Albert Gore, Sr.|Albert A. Gore, Sr.]], a politician, and [[Pauline LaFon Gore]], one of the first female lawyers to graduate from Vanderbilt Law School.  Since his [[father]] was a veteran Democratic senator from Tennessee, Al Gore, Jr. divided his childhood between Washington, D.C., and [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]], [[Tennessee]].  
During the school year, the younger Gore lived in a [[hotel]] in Washington, during summer vacations, he lived in Carthage, where he worked on the Gore family farm.

In 1970, Gore married Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson ([[Tipper Gore]]), whom he had first met many years before at his high school senior [[prom]] (St. Albans School in Washington, D.C.). They have four children: [[Karenna Gore|Karenna]] (born [[August 6]], [[1973]]), married to [[Drew Schiff]]; [[Kristin Gore|Kristin]] (born [[June 5]], [[1977]]); [[Sarah Gore|Sarah]] (born [[January 7]], [[1979]]); and [[Al Gore III|Al III]] (born [[October 19]], [[1982]]). The Gores also have two grandchildren: Wyatt (born [[July 4]], [[1999]]) and Anna Schiff.   

The Gores now reside in [[Nashville]], Tennessee, USA, and own a small farm near Carthage, Tennessee.  The family attends New Salem Missionary [[Baptist Church]] in Carthage. The Gores in late 2005 bought a condo at San Francisco's swanky St. Regis.

==Soldier and journalist==
[[Image:AlGoreVietnam.gif|right|thumb|200px|Gore served as a field reporter in Vietnam for four months.]]

Although opposed to the Vietnam War, on [[August 7]], [[1969]], Gore enlisted in the [[United States Army|army]] to participate in the [[Vietnam War]] effort.  After completing training as a military journalist, Gore shipped to [[Vietnam]] in early 1971, serving for four months before being given an honorable discharge.  The chronology of Gore's military service is as follows:
* '''August 1969''': Enlisted at the [[Newark, New Jersey]] recruiting office.  
* '''August to October 1969''': 8 weeks of basic training at [[Fort Dix]], [[New Jersey]]
* '''Late October 1969 to December 1970''': [[Fort Rucker]], [[Alabama]], on-the-job occupational training at the [[Army Flier]] newspaper.
* '''January 1971 to May 1971''': field reporter in [[Vietnam]], part of the 20th Engineer Brigade, stationed primarily at [[Bien Hoa]] Air Base near [[Saigon]].
* '''[[May 24]], [[1971]]''': Given an honorable discharge, after his early discharge request was granted.

Gore stated many times that he opposed the Vietnam War, but chose to enlist anyway.  Some observers have noted that Gore could have avoided Vietnam in a number of ways.  Gore considered all these options, but said that his sense of civic duty compelled him to serve. [[Alexander Cockburn]] and [[Jeffrey St. Clair]] suggest in ''[[Al Gore: A User's Manual]]'' that Gore joined the military for political gain.

Because Gore served as a journalist, he was never exposed to front-line combat. Although some allege that his famous father's influence helped him to obtain this position, most military analysts agree that any man who enlisted with a Harvard degree had a good chance of being assigned a support specialty rather than an infantry position (even at the war's height, 88% of all servicemen were assigned to noncombatant specialties). However, Gore's decision to enlist for a two year term did mean that he would not be able to select his assignment, a choice which was available to three year enlistees. According to [[Newsweek]] journalist [[Bill Turque]]'s [[biography]] ''[[Inventing Al Gore]]'' (which does not shy away from criticism and scandals, such as charging Gore with smoking [[marijuana]] far more frequently than he admits), 
:''Dess Stokes, staff sergeant at the Newark Armed Forces Entrance and Examination Station on the day he walked in, doesn't remember any communication from superiors about Gore. A kid with Gore's background (a 134 [[IQ]] and a Harvard degree), he said, didn't need to be a senator's son with high-level contacts to get the military job he wanted''. 

Gore's father, [[Al Gore Sr.]], lost the [[U.S. Senate election, 1970|1970 election]], and was no longer a Senator by the time Gore arrived in Vietnam, but was a Senator until January 1971 which included the time his son would have received his assignment. Some critics charge that his father's stature led Gore's superiors to give him less dangerous assignments than they might otherwise have given him. According to combat photographer [[H. Alan Leo]], Gore was protected from dangerous situations at the request of Brigadier General [[Kenneth B. Cooper]], the 20th Engineer Brigades Commander.  Leo stated that Gore's trips into the field were safe, and that Gore &quot;could have worn a tuxedo.&quot;  These remarks seem to contradict Gore's many public statements; 

:&quot;I carried an M-16. I pulled my turn on the perimeter at night and walked through the elephant grass and I was fired upon.&quot;(''[[Baltimore Sun]]'')
:&quot;I took my turn regularly on the perimeter in these little firebases out in the boonies. Something would move, we'd fire first and ask questions later.&quot; (''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'')
:&quot;I was shot at. I spent most of my time in the field.&quot; (''[[Washington Post]]'')
:&quot;I used to fly these things (combat helicopters) with the doors open, sitting on the ledge with our feet hanging down. If you flew low and fast, they wouldn't have as much time to shoot you.&quot;(''[[Weekly Standard]]'') 

For his part, Gore has stated that he knew Leo but rarely traveled with him in Vietnam, and that he never felt that he was being given special protection.  On the other hand, Leo's testimony is that Cooper gave the orders before Gore arrived, so Gore would not know about them.  The question of whether Leo frequently traveled with Gore or not still has not been conclusively answered.

Turque's book, however, states that 
:''[Cooper] said that he has no recollection of even meeting Leo, much less discussing Gore's safety with him. ...''
:''The evidence indicates that if there was an official effort to guarantee Gore's safety, it was uneven at best. His clippings from the Castle Courier, the newspaper of the U.S. Army Engineering Command, and other publications suggest that he pulled his weight, which in his case meant choppering around to report features about the good works of the 20th Engineers... When Smith said he was scheduled to leave for R&amp;amp;R in Hawaii, the sergeant called for volunteers. Gore stepped up and spent a cold night in a foxhole. &quot;Al did what everybody else did,&quot; said Mike O'Hara, the photographer who shot the Khe Sanh assignment...''
:''Regulations allowed for early release of personnel to teach or attend school if their services were deemed &quot;not essential to the mission,&quot; and Gore certainly qualified. ''

Gore stated in 1988 that his experience in Vietnam
:''didn't change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but it struck me that opponents to the war, including myself, really did not take into account the fact that there were an awful lot of South Vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom. Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for''.

After returning from Vietnam, Gore spent five years as a [[Journalist|reporter]] for the ''Tennessean'', a newspaper headquartered in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].  During this time, Gore also attended [[Vanderbilt University| Vanderbilt]] Divinity School and Law School, although he did not complete a degree at either.

==Congress==
[[Image:GoreSenate.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Al Gore speaks during a [[congressional hearing]] in the 1980s.]]
In the spring of 1976, Gore quit law school to run for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]], in [[United States House of Representatives, Tennessee District 4|Tennessee's fourth district]].  Gore defeated [[Stanley Rogers]] in the Democratic primary, then ran unopposed and was elected to his first [[Congress of the United States|Congressional]] post.  He was re-elected three times, in [[U.S. House election, 1978|1978]], [[U.S. House election, 1980|1980]], and [[U.S. House election, 1982|1982]].  In [[U.S. Senate election, 1984|1984]] Gore did not run for the House; instead he successfully ran for a seat in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], which had been vacated by Republican Majority Leader [[Howard Baker]].  Gore served as a Senator from Tennessee until 1993, when he became Vice President.

===House of Representatives===
On [[March 19]], [[1979]], Gore became the first person to appear on [[C-SPAN]], making a speech in the House chambers.

===Senate===

===1988 Presidential Run===
In 1988, Gore ran for President but failed to obtain the Democratic nomination, which went instead to [[Michael Dukakis]].

===Son's Accident and effect on 1992 Presidential run===
On [[April 3]], [[1989]], Gore's six-year-old son [[Al Gore III|Albert]] was nearly killed in an automobile accident while leaving the [[Baltimore Orioles]] opening game. Because of this and the resulting lengthy healing process, his father chose to stay near him during the recovery instead of laying the foundation for a presidential primary campaign against eventual nominee Bill Clinton. Gore started writing ''[[Earth in the Balance]]'', his book on environmental conservation, during his son's recovery.  ''Earth in the Balance'' became the first book written by a sitting senator to make ''[[The New York Times]]'' best-seller list since [[John F. Kennedy]]'s ''[[Profiles in Courage]]''.

===Congressional Committees===
While in Congress, Gore was a member of the following committees: [[U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services]] (Defense Industry and Technology Projection Forces and Regional Defense; [[Strategic Forces and Nuclear Deterrence]]); [[U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Commerce, Science and Transportation]] (Communications; Consumer; Science, Technology and Space- chairman 1992; [[Surface Transportatio]]n; [[National Ocean Policy]] Study); [[U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Printing|Joint Committee on Printing]]; [[U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee|Joint Economic Committee]]; [[U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|Rules and Administration]].

==Vice Presidency==
[[Image:ClintonGore2.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Vice President talking with President Clinton as the two pass through the Colonnade at the White House.]]
[[Bill Clinton]] chose Gore to be his running mate on [[July 9]], [[1992]], to the surprise of many as the two were both young and were from the same region of the nation.  After winning the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 election]], Al Gore was inaugurated as the 45th Vice President of the United States on [[January 20]], [[1993]]. Clinton and Gore were re-elected to a second term in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|1996 election]].

During his time as Vice President, Al Gore was mostly a behind the scenes player.  However, many experts consider him to be one of the most active and influential Vice Presidents in U.S. history. This was evident as Gore had weekly lunches with Clinton to keep each other abreast of current developments, although he later said that it was he who insisted on having those weekly lunches in the first place.

===Debate with Perot===
In 1993 Gore debated [[Ross Perot]] on [[CNN]]'s [[Larry King Live]] on the issue of [[free trade]]. Public opinion polls taken after the debate showed that a majority of Americans agreed with his point of view and supported [[NAFTA]]. Some claim that this performance may have been responsible for the passing of NAFTA in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], where it passed 234-200. [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/reinventing_government.html]

===Initatives===
One of Gore's major accomplishments as Vice President was the ''National Performance Review'', which pointed out waste, fraud, and other abuse in the federal government and stressed the need for cutting the size of the [[bureaucracy]] and the number of regulations.  His book later helped guide President Clinton when he down sized the [[federal government]]. [http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/speeches/interego.html]  

====Internet Education====
As Vice President, Gore instituted a federal program calling for all schools and libraries to be wired to the [[Internet]]. This was a culmination of work that he had started several years before. While serving in the Senate, Gore had introduced legislation which called for the creation of a new federal research center for educational computing to support an &quot;information systems highway&quot;. [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/technology.html]

====Environment====
During Gore's tenure as Vice President, he was a strong proponent for environmental protection. While a senator working on his book ''Earth in the Balance'', Gore had traveled around the world on numerous fact-finding  missions. On [[Earth Day]] 1994, Gore launched the worldwide [[GLOBE program]], an innovative hands-on, school-based education and science activity that made extensive use of the Internet to increase student awareness of their environment and contribute research data for scientists.

The opinions he developed on issues such as global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer, and the destruction of rain forests is said to have played a major role in policy making for the Clinton administration. In the late nineties, Gore strongly pushed for the passage of the [[Kyoto Treaty]], which called for reduction in green house emissions. [http://web.archive.org/web/20001207090900/www.algore.com/speeches/speeches_kyoto_120897.html], [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/environment.html]

====Foreign Policy====
Because of President Clinton's inexperience and Gore's service in Vietnam and in the Senate, Clinton would often look to Gore for advice in the area of foreign policy.  Gore was one of the first to call for action to remove Yugoslav President [[Slobodan Milošević]] from power in 1998.  Gore also supported [[Operation Desert Fox]], a three day bombing campaign against Iraq that attempted to &quot;degrade Saddam Hussein's ability to make and to use weapons of mass destruction.&quot; [http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/desert_fox/], [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/foreign_policy.html]

[[Image:Algoreyasser.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Vice President Al Gore works along side President Clinton in trying to negotiate a Middle East peace plan with Palestinian leader [[Yasser Arafat]].]]

====Other====
During the Clinton/Gore administration, Americans enjoyed eight years of relative peace along with the longest economic expansion in history.  Democrats attributed this prosperity to the policies of the Clinton/Gore administration, and especially to the passage of the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]], for which Gore cast the [[U.S. Vice President's tie-breaking votes|tie-breaking vote]].  During his 2000 campaign for the presidency, Gore attributed several positive economic results to his and Clinton's policies [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/economy.html]  more than 22 million new jobs, highest homeownership in American history, Lowest unemployment in 30 years, Paid off $360 billion of the national debt, lowest poverty rate in 20 years, higher incomes at all levels, converted the largest budget deficit, up to that time, in American history to the largest surplus, lowest government spending in three decades, lowest federal income tax burden in 35 years, and more families own stock than ever before.  However Gore later placed a large share of the blame for his election loss on the economic downturn and NASDAQ crash of March 2000 in an interview with [[National Public Radio]]'s [[Bob Edwards]]. [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=848572]

==2000 presidential election==
{{main articles|[[Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 2000]]}}
[[Image:Goreconvention.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Al Gore and running-mate Joe Lieberman at the [[2000 Democratic National Convention]].]]
After two terms as Vice President, Gore ran for [[President of the United States|President]]. In the Democratic primaries, Gore faced an early challenge from [[Bill Bradley]]. Gore's nomination was never really in doubt and Bradley withdrew from the race in early March 2000 after failing to win any state primary or caucus. 

In August 2000, Gore surprised many when he selected United States Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] to be his vice-presidential running mate. Lieberman, who is a more conservative Democrat than Gore, had publicly blasted President Clinton for the [[Monica Lewinsky]] affair. Many pundits saw Gore's choice of Lieberman as another way of trying to distance himself from the scandal-prone Clinton White House. Lieberman was also the first Jewish nominee on a major party's national ticket.

During the entire campaign, Gore was neck-and-neck in the polls with [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[Governor of Texas]] [[George W. Bush]].  On Election Day, the results were so close that the outcome of the race took over a month to resolve, highlighted by the premature declaration of a winner on election night, and an extremely close result in the state of [[Florida]]. On election night, news networks first called Florida for Gore, then Fox News decided to call it for Bush and all of the other news stations followed their decision.

The race was ultimately decided by a razor thin margin of only 537 popular votes in Florida, a state favored to have gone to Bush (as his brother served as Governor).  The 537 number was an astonishingly close margin out of some 105 million votes cast nationwide. Florida's 25 electoral votes were awarded to George W. Bush only after numerous court challenges. Al Gore publicly conceded the election after the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' voted 7 to 2 to declare the ongoing recount procedure unconstitutional because it feared that different standards would be used in different parts of the state, and 5 to 4 to ban recounts using other procedures.  [[Image:Gore_Debate.jpg|thumb|200px|Al Gore makes a point during a [[U.S. presidential debate|presidential debate]] during the 2000 election as George W. Bush looks on.]] Gore strongly disagreed with the Court's decision, but decided &quot;for the sake of our unity of the people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.&quot;  He had previously made a concession phone call to Bush the night of the election, but quickly retracted it after learning just how close the election was. Following the election, a subsequent recount conducted by various U.S. news media organizations indicated that Mr. Bush would have won using the partial recount method of 4 strongly Democratic areas advocated by Mr. Gore, but that Mr. Gore would have won given a full recount of the state. [http://www.bushwatch.com/gorebush.htm][http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/florida.ballots/stories/main.html].

The states that ultimately voted for Gore over Bush in the 2000 elections were New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Mexico, California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota and Hawaii giving Gore 267 electoral votes to Bush's 271. One of Gore's electors cast a blank ballot, to protest what she called DC's &quot;colonial status&quot;, thus the candidate's final number of electoral votes was 266.

The Florida election has been closely scrutinized since the election. Critics have argued that the Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush (Brother of George W. Bush) and the Secretary of State of Florida, Katherine Harris, did play a part in ensuring that the state was in the red column of the Republicans come election day. Several irregularities are thought to have favored Bush; others may have given Gore an edge. Irregularities favoring Bush included the notorious Palm Beach &quot;butterfly ballots&quot;, which were alleged to have produced an unexpectedly large number of votes for [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] candidate [[Pat Buchanan]], and a purge of some 50,000 alleged felons from the Florida voting rolls that included some voters who were again eligible to vote under Florida law. Many Bush supporters, however, believed that an unfair advantage was given to Gore when all major news networks, early on, prematurely projected Gore as the winner of Florida's 25 electoral votes at 7:52 PM Eastern Time.  This happened before the polls closed in 10 Florida counties in the heavily Republican western panhandle which are in the Central Time Zone, and thus closed at 7 PM Central Time (8 PM Eastern).  Some have thought that this depressed the pro-Bush vote in that area. [http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/02/02/cnn.report/cnn.pdf] During the numerous recounts (which made the phrase &quot;hanging chads&quot; infamous in the American vocabulary), there were also allegations of both pro-Bush and pro-Gore tampering by low-level operatives in the controversial counties. [http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2000/11/26/230955.shtml] It is unclear what effect, if any, this may have had.  And while the Gore camp fought (with some success) to keep overseas absentee votes out in counties thought to be pro-Bush, Bush operatives similarly (albeit while drawing less attention to their efforts) prevented the counting of overseas absentee votes in strong Democratic counties.  Both sides contended that the votes were cast after Election Day, and since many of the envelopes did not have cancelled stamps, it was not clear when the votes were cast.  Reports later surfaced that many overseas voters attempted to vote only after learning of the closeness of the Florida vote.

Some commentators still see such irregularities, and the legal maneuvering around the recounts as casting doubt on the legitimacy of the vote; as a matter of law, however, the issue was settled, albeit controversially again, when the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] accepted Florida's electoral delegation, only after a challenge to the Florida electors was presented in the congressional chambers on [[January 6]], [[2001]] by members of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]]. Member after member went up decrying the lack of a senator who would be willing to co-sponsor the challenge without any effect. They thus failed to bring the challenge to a debate.  

Concern about the possible disenfranchisement of voters in the Florida vote led to widespread calls for electoral reform in the United States, and ultimately to the passage of the [[Help America Vote Act]], which authorized the [[United States federal government]] to provide funds to the states to replace their mechanical voting equipment with [[electronic voting]] equipment. However, this has led to new controversies, because of the security weaknesses of the computer systems, the lack of paper-based methods of secure verification, and the necessity to rely on the trustworthiness of the manufacturers whose employees also count those votes.
Although Gore won the nationwide popular vote by more than 500,000 votes, he lost the election by five electoral votes (with one D.C. elector, pledged to Gore, casting a blank ballot to protest the District's lack of representation in Congress).

[[Image:Al Gore on Futurama.JPG|thumb|[[Recurring_characters_of_Futurama#Al_Gore|Al Gore]] on [[Futurama]].]]

Joe Lieberman later criticized Al Gore for adopting a populist theme during their 2000 campaign. Lieberman said he objected to Gore's &quot;people vs. the powerful&quot; message, believing it was not the best strategy for Democrats to use to recapture the White House.[http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=28519]

While running for president in 2000, Al Gore was used as a voice actor for the television show ''[[Futurama]]'' (for which his daughter, Kristin, was a writer). He played [[Recurring characters of Futurama#Al Gore|himself]] again in another episode after the campaign was over.

==Private citizen==
===Professor Gore===
[[Image:Goreharvard2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|left|Al Gore re-emerges in 2001 as a visiting professor with a [[beard]].]]
Following his election loss, Gore accepted visiting [[professor]]ships at [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism]], [[Middle Tennessee State University]], [[University of California Los Angeles]], and [[Fisk University]]. In late 2001, Al Gore became a Senior Advisor to [[Google|Google]] and Vice Chairman of [[Los Angeles]]-based financial firm [[Metropolitan West Financial LLC]].

===Blasting Bush===
On [[September 23]], 2002, Gore spoke in [[San Francisco]] to The [[Commonwealth Club]] and made a controversial speech blasting Bush on the Iraq war [http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2002-09-23-gore_x.htm] Although he admitted Saddam was a potential danger saying: &quot;We know that [Saddam] has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power&quot;[http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/02/02-09gore-speech.html]  He also spoke against rushing to war with Iraq, advising caution and saying that Iraq was a diversion from fighting Al-Qaeda and terrorism in Afghanistan and elsewhere: &quot;I don't think that we should allow anything to diminish our focus on avenging the 3,000 Americans who were murdered and dismantling the network of terrorists who we know to be responsible for it. The fact that we don't know where they are should not cause us to focus instead on some other enemy whose location may be easier to identify.&quot;

Following the [[November 5]], [[2002]], midterm elections Gore re-emerged into the public eye with a 14-city book tour and a well-orchestrated &quot;full Gore&quot; media blitz which included a pair of policy speeches. On [[September 23]], Gore delivered a speech on the impending [[2003 invasion of Iraq|War with Iraq]] and the [[War on Terrorism]] that generated a fair amount of commentary. Less than two weeks later, on October 2, he made a speech on Bush's handling of the economy to the [[Brookings Institution]]. Also, during this time period Gore guest starred on several programs such as [[The Late Show with David Letterman]] and [[Saturday Night Live]] (with legendary rock band [[Phish]]), appearing much more relaxed and funnier as a private citizen than he did while holding public office.

[[Image:Goresnl.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Al Gore hosting ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' along side ''[[The West Wing (television)|West Wing]]'' stars [[Martin Sheen]] and [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]].]]
In 2003 Gore joined the board of directors of [[Apple Computer]].  On the political front, Gore kept his promise of staying involved in public debate when he offered his criticism and advice to the [[Bush Administration]] on key topics such as the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Occupation of Iraq]], [[USA Patriot Act]], and [[natural environment|environmental]] issues, most notably [[global warming]].  Gore also continued to visit campuses across the nation lecturing on issues such as [[race]], [[media]], and [[democracy]].

On [[April 10]], [[2004]], Gore met with the [[9-11 Commission]] in private to give his testimony on what his administration did to prevent terror attacks. In a statement after the three-hour session, the commission said he was candid and forthcoming, and it thanked him for his &quot;continued cooperation.&quot;

In the summer of 2004, Gore teamed up with [[MoveOn.org]], to promote the new science fiction film, [[The Day After Tomorrow|''The Day After Tomorrow'']].  Although Gore said the movie was a far-fetched example of global warming, he said the movie would escalate public debate on the issue.

On [[April 27]], [[2005]], Gore gave an hour-long speech lambasting the GOP's effort to do away with the legislative [[filibuster]].  In response to Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]], who for weeks had repeated threats to impose the &quot;[[nuclear option]]&quot; if [[Senate]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] did not stop blocking judicial nominees via the filibuster, Gore said, &quot;Their grand design is an all-powerful executive using a weakened [[legislature]] to fashion a compliant judiciary in its own image. The Senate has confirmed 205 or over 95% of President Bush's nominees.  Democrats have held up only 10 nominees, less than 5%. Compare that with the 60 Clinton nominees who were blocked by Republican obstruction between 1995 and 2000.  What is involved here is a power grab,&quot; Gore said.  Gore also took aim at what he called &quot;religious zealots&quot; who claim special knowledge of [[god (monotheism)|God's]] will in [[American politics]].  He went on to say, &quot;They even claim that those of us who disagree with their point of view are waging war against people of faith. How dare they!&quot;  This was Gore's first major policy speech of 2005 and also the first one since the defeat of Democratic hopeful John Kerry in late 2004.

In May 2005, Gore was awarded a lifetime achievement award for three decades of contributions to the Internet.  The [[Webby Awards]], which are widely hailed as the ''[[Oscars]]'' of the web, &quot;wanted to set the record straight&quot; about Al Gore and the Internet once and for all.   [[Tiffany Shlain]], the awards' founder and chairwoman said, &quot;It's just one of those instances someone did amazing work for three decades as congressman, senator and vice president and it got spun around into this political mess,&quot; Shlain said. [http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2005-05-04-gore-webby_x.htm]

In September 2005, Gore chartered two aircraft to evacuate 270 evacuees from New Orleans in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. [http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/sns-ap-katrina-gore,1,535141.story?coll=sns-ap-nation-headlines&amp;amp;ctrack=1&amp;amp;cset=true] He was highly critical of the government and federal response in the days after the hurricane.

===Future===
Speaking at an economic forum in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], in October 2005, Gore again stated that he has no intention of ever running for president again in response to questions from reporters.  However, Gore said he could not rule the possibility out completely saying, &quot;I do not completely rule out some future interest, but I do not expect to have that.&quot; When asked how the United States would have been different if he had become president, Gore stated, &quot;We would not have invaded a country that didn't attack us,&quot; he said, referring to Iraq. &quot;We would not have taken money from the working families and given it to the most wealthy families.&quot; &quot;We would not be trying to control and intimidate the news media. We would not be routinely torturing people,&quot; Gore said. [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/12/politics/main938098.shtml]

In the past few years, Gore has remained busy traveling the world speaking and participating in events mainly aimed towards global warming awareness and prevention.

On January 2006, Al Gore delivered a major speech criticising President Bush's use of domestic wiretaps. Gore stated that Bush broke the law and recommended an independent counsel investigate the matter further. Also in January 2006, Al Gore was the leading man in the Sundance global warming documentary ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''. 

Al Gore will be publishing a second book on global warming titled &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; in April 2006. 

On February 12, 2006: Former US vice-president Al Gore on Sunday said that the US government had committed ‘terrible abuses’ against Arabs living in America after 9/11 attacks, and that most Americans did not support such treatment.

“The thoughtless way in which visas are now handled, that is a mistake,” Mr Gore said at the Jeddah Economic Forum. “The worst thing we can possibly do is to cut off the channels of friendship and mutual understanding between Saudi Arabia and the United States.”

The former US vice-president told this Saudi audience, many of them educated in US universities, that Arabs in the United States had been “indiscriminately rounded up, often on minor charges of overstaying a visa or not having a green card in proper order, and held in conditions that were just unforgivable.”

“Unfortunately there have been terrible abuses and it’s wrong. I do want you to know that it does not represent the desires or wishes or feelings of the majority of the citizens of my country.”

Terrence Jeffrey of [[Human Events]] and [[Jack Kelly]] of [[RealClearPolitics.com]] however criticized Gore's comments, and pointed out that [[9/11 Commission]] (page 492) reported that [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], who planned the attacks, told interrogators most of the hijackers he selected were Saudis because they had the easiest time getting visas. [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-2_17_06_JKE.html] [http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004544.htm] [[Mohammad Atta]] himself was in the United States, having overstayed his visa.

====Television network====
{{main|Current TV}}
[[Image:Current.png|right|thumb|200px|Al Gore's ''Current'' official logo.]]
On [[May 4]], [[2004]], [[INdTV]] Holdings, a company co-founded by Gore and [[Joel Hyatt]], purchased cable news channel [[NewsWorld International]] from [[Vivendi Universal]].  The new network will not have political leanings, Gore said, but will serve as an &quot;independent voice&quot; for a target audience of people between 18 and 34 &quot;who want to learn about the world in a voice they recognize and a view they recognize as their own.&quot; The network was relaunched under the name [[Current TV|Current]] on [[August 1]], [[2005]].

====Investment firm====
In late 2004, it was announced that Al Gore had launched and will chair an investment firm to seek out companies taking a responsible view on big global issues like [[climate change]].

Gore's group, [[Generation Investment Management]], was created to assist the growing demand for an investment style which can bring returns by blending traditional equity research with a focus on more intangible non-financial factors such as social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance.

==2004 presidential election==
===Endorsing Dean===
[[Image:AlGoreHowardDean.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Al Gore shocked many when he did not endorse his 2000 running mate Joe Lieberman, but the outsider candidate, Howard Dean, in 2003.]]
Initially, Al Gore was touted as a logical opponent of George W. Bush in the [[2004 United States Presidential Election]]. &lt;!-- &quot;Re-elect Gore!&quot; was a common slogan among many Democrats who felt the former Vice President had been unfairly cheated out of the presidency, on the grounds that he had won the popular vote and (in the opinion of many){{fact}} should have won the Electoral College vote. --&gt;  On [[December 16]], [[2002]] however, Gore announced that he would not run in 2004, saying that it was time for &quot;fresh faces&quot; and &quot;new ideas&quot; to emerge from the Democrats. When he appeared on a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview, Gore said that he felt if he had run, the focus of the election would be the rematch rather than the issues. Gore's former running mate, Joe Lieberman quickly announced his own candidacy for the presidency, which he had vowed he would not do if Gore ran.

Despite Gore taking himself out of the race, a handful of his supporters formed a national campaign to &quot;[[political draft|draft]]&quot; him into running.  However, that effort largely came to an end when Gore publicly endorsed [[Governor of Vermont|Vermont Governor]] [[Howard Dean]] (over his former running mate [[Joe Lieberman]]) weeks before the first primary of the election cycle. There was still some effort to encourage write-in votes for Gore in the primaries by a different group of Gore supporters who were separate from the draft movement. Although Gore did receive a small number of votes in New Hampshire and New Mexico, that effort was halted when [[John Kerry]] pulled into the lead for the nomination. Gore's endorsement of Dean was helpful to the latter in legitimizing him in the eyes of the establishment faction of the Democratic Party, but it also led the media to dub Dean as the clear front-runner, with the result that his opponents devoted more of their emphasis to opposing him.

===Campaigning against Bush===
On [[January 15]], [[2004]], Al Gore gave a major policy address in [[New York City]] on [[climate change]] and the Bush administration's approach to the environment.  Accompanied by slides and projector, Gore slammed the Bush administration's attitude towards global warming saying, &quot;There are many who still do not believe that global warming is a problem at all. And it's no wonder: because they are the targets of a massive and well-organized campaign of disinformation lavishly funded by polluters who are determined to prevent any action to reduce the [[greenhouse gas]] [[emissions]] that cause global warming, out of a fear that their profits might be affected if they had to stop dumping so much pollution into the atmosphere.&quot;

On [[February 9]], [[2004]], on the eve of the [[Tennessee]] primary, Gore gave what many consider his harshest criticism of the president yet when he accused [[George W. Bush]] of betraying the country by using the 9/11 attacks as a justification for the invasion of Iraq. &quot;He betrayed this country!&quot; Mr. Gore shouted into the microphone.  &quot;He played on our fears! He took America on an ill-conceived foreign adventure dangerous to our troops, an adventure preordained and planned before 9/11 ever took place!&quot;  Gore also urged all Democrats to unite behind their eventual nominee proclaiming, &quot;Any one of these candidates is far better than George W. Bush.&quot;  In [[March 2004]] Gore, along with former Presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Jimmy Carter]], united behind Kerry as the presumptive Democratic nominee.

[[Image:AlGoreSpeaking2004.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Al Gore, who just four years prior accepted his party's nomination, speaks as a party elder at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.]]

On [[April 28]], [[2004]], Gore announced that he would be donating $6 million to various Democratic Party groups.  Drawing from his funds left over from his [[Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000|2000 presidential campaign]], Gore pledged to donate $4 million to the [[Democratic National Committee]]. The party's Senate and House committees would each get $1 million, and the party from Gore's home state of [[Tennessee]] would receive $250,000. In addition, Gore announced that all of the surplus funds in his &quot;Recount Fund&quot; from the 2000 election controversy that resulted in the Supreme Court halting the counting of the ballots, a total of $240,000, will be donated to the [[Florida]] Democratic Party.

In his speech, Gore stressed the importance of voting and having every vote counted, a point that foreshadowed the [[2004 U.S. election voting controversies]].

On [[May 26]], [[2004]], Gore gave a highly critical speech on the Iraq crisis and the [[Bush Administration]].  In the speech, Gore demanded [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]], [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[George Tenet]], [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Paul Wolfowitz]], [[Undersecretary of Defense for Policy]] [[Douglas Feith]], and [[Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence]] [[Stephen Cambone]] all resign for encouraging policies that led to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners and fanned hatred of Americans abroad.  During the fiery speech, which lasted more than an hour, Gore called the Bush administration's Iraq war plan &quot;incompetent&quot; and called George W. Bush the most dishonest president since [[Richard Nixon]], who resigned the office of the presidency in 1974 following the [[Watergate]] scandal. 

Gore also decried the [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse|abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib Prison in Iraq]], saying, &quot;What happened at that prison, it is now clear, is not the result of random acts of a few bad apples. It was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy.&quot;

====Convention====
As the first major speaker at the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]], Gore held himself out as a living reminder that every vote counts.  &quot;Let's make sure not only that the Supreme Court does not pick the next president, but also that this president is not the one who picks the next Supreme Court,&quot; said Gore.  Gore directed remarks to supporters of third-party presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]], who abandoned the Democratic Party four years ago, asking them, &quot;Do you still believe that there was no difference between the candidates?&quot;

====Post-Convention====
On [[October 18]], 2004, Al Gore delivered his final major policy speech of the 2004 political season.  In an hour long presentation, Gore concluded that, &quot;I'm convinced that most of the president's frequent departures from fact-based analysis have much more to do with right-wing political and economic [[ideology]] than with the [[Bible]].&quot;

==Views and controversies==
{{main|Al Gore controversies}}
Gore is a strong supporter of [[abortion]] rights, [[free trade]], and strong [[environmentalism|environmental]] policy. He was a vocal opponent of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] [http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/02/02-09gore-speech.html].
Gore has gradually moved politically further [[Left-wing politics | left]]; he was once a moderate-to-conservative lawmaker. While in Congress, Gore had a strong pro-life record on abortion and voted pro-life 27 times. When exactly Gore became pro-choice is unknown, but by 1988, when he sought the Democratic presidential nomination, he was on record as opposing the criminalization of abortion.

Critics have charged Gore with [[1996 U.S. campaign finance scandal|illegal fundraising]] at a Buddhist temple and illegal use of his government office and telephone for political fundraising in violation of the Hatch Act, although he was never indicted on such a charge.

===The Internet===
Gore is a frequent target of satire, based on his supposedly having claimed to have invented the Internet. In fact he never made such a claim [http://www.snopes.com/quotes/internet.asp]. Rather, during an interview with [[Wolf Blitzer]] on [[CNN]]'s &quot;Late Edition&quot; on March 9, 1999, Gore stated:

: During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system [http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/03/09/president.2000/transcript.gore].

The phrase from the statement above which sparked the debate, &quot;I took the initiative in creating the Internet,&quot; referred to Gore's involvement with and  sponsorship of the ''High Performance Computing Act of 1991'' which advanced the growth and mainstreaming of the Internet during the [[1990s]] [http://www.mit.edu/afs/net.mit.edu/dev/mit/jis/OldFiles/nrenbill.txt]. 

This statement was later defended by Internet pioneers [[Bob Kahn|Robert Kahn]] and [[Vinton Cerf]] [http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200009/msg00052.html]:

: ...as the two people who designed the basic architecture and the core protocols that make the Internet work, we would like to acknowledge VP Gore's contributions as a Congressman, Senator and as Vice President.  No other elected official, to our knowledge, has made a greater contribution over a longer period of time.

===Accusations of hypocrisy by McClellan and Gonzales===
On the 16th of January, 2006, Gore accused U.S. [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] of &quot;breaking the law repeatedly and insistently,&quot; and called for a special investigation of [[NSA]] spying on Americans because the spying was without a warrant from a special federal court that authorizes such requests to eavesdrop on Americans.

Bush press secretary [[Scott McClellan]] and Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]] both responded to reporters that the Clinton-Gore administration had done illegal warrantless physical searches themselves of [[Aldrich Ames]] without permission from a judge. 

&quot;I think his hypocrisy knows no bounds,&quot; McClellan said of Gore. But the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] at the time did not cover physical searches. The law had changed in 1995. Gore claimed that because Gonzales made a &quot;political defense&quot; for Bush, he was no longer eligible to review charges against Bush and therefore must name a [[special counsel]]. 

&quot;His charges are factually wrong,&quot; said Gore, &quot;Both before and after the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] was amended in 1995; the Clinton-Gore administration complied fully and completely with the terms of the law.&quot; [http://www.forbes.com/business/manufacturing/feeds/ap/2006/01/17/ap2456266.html]

'''Animal Farm''' is a [[satire|satirical]] [[novel]] (which can also be understood as a modern [[fable]] or [[allegory]]) by [[George Orwell]], ostensibly about a group of animals who oust the humans from the [[farm]] they live on and run it themselves, only to have it corrupted into a brutal tyranny on its own. It was written during [[World War II]] and published in 1945, although it was not widely successful until the late [[1950s]].

''Animal Farm'' is a thinly veiled critique and satire of Soviet [[totalitarianism]]. Many events in the book are based on events from the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Stalin]] era.  Orwell, though a leftist — he was for many years a member of the [[Independent Labour Party]] — was a critic of Stalin, and suspicious of Moscow-directed communism after his experiences in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
When the farm's prize-winning pig, [[Old Major]], calls a meeting of all the animals of Manor Farm, he tells them that he has had a dream in which mankind is gone, and animals are free to live in peace and harmony. He compares the humans to parasites, and then proceeds to teach the animals a [[revolution]]ary song, &quot;[[Beasts of England]]&quot;. The other animals begin to hope and dream for the revolution of such a day. When Old Major dies, a mere three days later, three pigs -- [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] (who teaches the animals to read), [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], and [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]] -- assume command, and turn his dream into a full-fledged philosophy. One night, the starved animals suddenly revolt and drive the farmer [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]], his wife, and his pet raven off the farm and take control. The farm is renamed &quot;Animal Farm&quot; as the animals work towards a future [[utopia]]. The [[Seven Commandments]] of the new philosophy of [[Animalism]] are written on the wall of a barn for all to read, the seventh and most important of which is that &quot;all animals are equal&quot;. All animals work, but the [[horse|workhorse]] [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] does more than his fair share and adopts a [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]] of his own — &quot;I will work harder.&quot;

Animal Farm is off to a great start. Snowball teaches the other animals to [[reading (activity)|read]] and write (though few animals besides the pigs learn to read well), food is plentiful due to a good harvest, and the entire Farm is organized and running smoothly. Even when Mr. Jones tries his last-ditch effort to retake control of the farm, the animals easily defeat him at what they later call the &quot;[[Battle of the Cowshed]]&quot;. Soon, however, things begin to unravel as Napoleon and Snowball begin an epic power struggle over the farm. When Snowball announces his idea for a [[windmill]], Napoleon quickly opposes it. A meeting is held, and when Snowball makes his passionate and articulate speech in favour of the windmill, Napoleon only makes a brief retort and then makes a strange noise to call in nine attack dogs. They burst in and chase Snowball off of the farm. In his absence, Napoleon declares himself the leader of the farm and makes instant changes. He announces that meetings will no longer be held as before, and a committee of pigs alone will decide what happens with the farm.

Napoleon changes his mind about the windmill, claiming (through Squealer) that Snowball stole the idea from him, and the animals begin to work. After a violent [[storm]], the animals wake to find the fruit of their months of labour utterly annihilated. Though neighbouring [[farmer]]s scoff at the thin walls, Napoleon and Squealer convince everyone that Snowball destroyed it. Napoleon begins to purge the farm, killing many animals he accuses of consorting with Snowball. In the meantime, Boxer takes a second [[mantra]], &quot;Napoleon is always right.&quot; 

Napoleon begins to abuse his powers even more and life on the farm becomes harder and harder for the rest of the animals. The pigs impose more and more controls on them while reserving [[privilege]]s for themselves. History is rewritten to villainise Snowball and glorify Napoleon even further. Each step of this development is justified by the pig, Squealer, who on several occasions alters the Seven Commandments on the barn in the dead of night. The song &quot;Beasts of England&quot; is banned as inappropriate now that the dream of Animal Farm has been realised, and is replaced by an anthem glorifying Napoleon who begins to live more and more like a human. The animals, though cold, starving, and overworked, remain convinced that they are still better off than when they were ruled by a man named Jones.

[[Frederick (Animal Farm)|Mr. Frederick]], one of the two neighbouring farmers, swindles Napoleon by paying with forged banknotes, and then attacks the farm and uses [[dynamite]] to blow up the recently restored windmill. Though the animals of Animal Farm eventually win the battle, they do so at a great cost, as many of the animals, including Boxer, are wounded. However, Boxer continues to work harder and harder, until he finally collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to come and take Boxer to the veterinarian, but as Boxer is loaded up and the van drives away, the animals read what is written on the side of the van: &quot;Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler.&quot; Squealer quickly reports that the van with the old writing has been purchased by the hospital, and later that Boxer has died in the hospital, in spite of the best medical care. 

Many years pass, and the pigs learn to walk upright, carry [[whip]]s, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are reduced to a single phrase: &quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&quot; Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs, and the humans of the area (in the adjacent Foxwood Farm run by Mr. [[Pilkington (Animal Farm)|Pilkington]]). He announces his alliance with the humans against the labouring classes of both &quot;worlds&quot;.

The animals discover this when they overhear Napoleon's conversations and finally realize that a change has come over the ruling pigs. During a poker match, an argument breaks out between Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington when they both play an [[Ace of Spades]], and the animals realise how they cannot tell the difference between the pigs and the humans.

The pigs walked on two feet and they adopted many of Mr. Jones' customs and principles. The pigs have violated every one of the rules set out in the beginning which they set up. This is when we come to the theme of this book: power corrupts.

==Plot references to real events==
*The ousting of the Humans after the farmers forget to feed the animals – [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] led to the removal of the Tsars after a series of famine and poverty.
*The refusal of the Humans to refer to Animal Farm by its new name (still calling it Manor Farm) may be indicative of the diplomatic limbo in which the Soviets existed following their early history. 
*Mr. Jones' last ditch effort to re-take the farm (The Battle of the Cowshed) – [[Russian Civil War]] in which the western capitalist governments sent soldiers to try to remove the Bolsheviks from power.
*Napoleon's removal of Snowball – [[Stalin]]’s removal of [[Leon Trotsky]] from power in 1927 and his subsequent expulsion.
*Napoleon stealing Snowball’s idea for a windmill – Stalin later shifted away from &quot;[[World revolution|World Socialism]]&quot; to &quot;[[Socialism in one country]]&quot; which Trotsky had originally promoted. The windmill can also be considered a symbol of the Soviet [[Five-Year Plan|Five-Year Plans]], a concept developed by Trotsky and adopted by Stalin, who claimed them to be his idea.
*Moses the raven leaving the farm for a while and then returning — Similar to the Russian Orthodox Church going underground and then being brought back to give the workers hope.
*Boxer's motto, &quot;Napoleon is always right&quot; is strikingly similar to &quot;Mussolini is always right&quot; a chant used to hail [[Benito Mussolini]] during his rule of [[Italy]] from 1922 to 1943.
*During the rise of Napoleon, he ordered the collection of all the hens' eggs. In an act of defiance, the Hens destroyed their eggs rather than give them to Napoleon — During Stalin's [[collectivization]] period in the early 1930s, many Ukrainian peasants burned their crops and farms rather than handing them over to the government.
*Napoleon's mass executions, of which many were unfair for the alleged crimes — [[Stalin]] executed his political enemies for various crimes after they were tortured and forced to falsely confess.
*The four pigs that go against Napoleon's will represent the [[White movement]].
*Napoleon's replacement of the farm anthem &quot;[[Beasts of England]]&quot; with an inane composition by the pig poet Minimus (&quot;Animal Farm, Animal Farm / Never through me / Will you come to harm&quot;) – In 1943, Stalin replaced the old national anthem &quot;[[the Internationale]]&quot; with &quot;the [[National Anthem of the Soviet Union|Hymn of the Soviet Union]].&quot; The old internationale glorified the revolution and &quot;the people.&quot; The original version of the Hymn of the Soviet Union glorified Stalin so heavily that after his death in 1953, entire sections of the anthem had to be replaced or removed. Orwell could have also been referring to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s banning of the French national hymn, [[La Marseillaise]] in 1799.
*Napoleon's dealing with Mr. Frederick, who eventually betrays Animal Farm and destroys the windmill. Though Animal Farm repels the human attack, many animals are wounded and killed — Stalin’s [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939, which was later betrayed in 1941 when [[Operation Barbarossa|Hitler invaded the Soviet Union]]. Though the Soviet Union won the war, it came at a tremendous price of roughly 8.5-15 million Soviet soldiers (unconfirmed) and many civilians, coming to an incredible estimated 20 million dead, as well as the utter destruction of the Western Soviet Union and its prized collective farms which Stalin had created in the 1930s.
*Napoleon's later alliance with the humans — Stalin’s non-aggression pact with Hitler in the early years of WWII.
*Napoleon's changing Animal Farm back to Manor — The [[Red Army]]’s name was changed from the &quot;Workers' and Peasants' Red Army&quot; to the &quot;Soviet Army&quot; to appear as a more appealing and professional organization rather than an army of the common people. 
*After Old Major dies, his skull is placed on display on a tree stump. Similarly, [[Vladmir Lenin|Lenin's]] (whom Old Major is based on along with Karl Marx) embalmed body was put on display in [[Lenin's mausoleum|Lenin's Tomb]] in [[Red Square]] postmortem, where it still remains.
*Squealer, constantly changing the commandments, is said to be a reference to a perversion in Russian religious history, as observed by [[Leo Tolstoy]] when the essential precepts of the [[Sermon on the Mount]] were altered by [[Russian Orthodox]] Church. It may also refer to the revision of history texts to glorify Stalin during his regime.

== Characters ==
The events and characters in Animal Farm are all carefully drawn to represent the history of the Soviet Union; Orwell makes this explicit in the case of Napoleon, whom he directly connects to Stalin in a letter of [[17 March]] [[1945]] to the publisher. 

:..when the windmill is blown up, I wrote 'all the animals including Napoleon flung themselves on their faces'.  I would like to alter it to 'all the animals except Napoleon'.  If that has been printed it's not worth bothering about, but I just thought the alteration would be fair to JS [Joseph Stalin], as he did stay in Moscow during the German advance.

The other characters have their analogies in the real world, but care should be taken with these comparisons as they do not always match history exactly and often simply represent generalised concepts.

===The pigs===
*[[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]] — The pig who becomes the leader of Animal Farm post-Rebellion. Created based on the actions of [[Joseph Stalin]], he uses his military (of nine attack dogs) to cement his power through fear. Napoleon craftily drives out his opponent, Snowball.
*[[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] — The pig who fights Napoleon for control post-Rebellion. Inspired by [[Leon Trotsky]], Snowball is a passionate intellectual and is far more honest about his motives than Napoleon. Snowball easily wins the loyalty of most of the animals. Trotsky was driven into exile in Mexico where he was assassinated.
*[[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]] — The pig who serves as public speaker. Inspired by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and the Russian paper [[Pravda]], Squealer twists and abuses the language to excuse, justify and extol Napoleon's actions, no matter how egregious. All his life, George Orwell made it a point to show how politicians used language. Squealer limits the debate by complicating it, and he confuses and disorients, making claims that the pigs need the extra luxury they are taking in order to function properly. To squeal is to betray, something Squealer does often to his fellow animals.
*Minimus — A poet pig who writes a song about Napoleon, representing admirers of Stalin both inside and outside the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] such as [[Maxim Gorky]].
*[[Old Major (Animal Farm)|Old Major]] — As a fellow socialist, Orwell agreed with some of [[Karl Marx]]'s politics, and even respected [[Vladimir Lenin]]. In fact, the satire in Animal Farm is not of Marxism, or Lenin's revolution, but of the corruption that occurred later. Major, who is based upon both Lenin and Marx, is the inspiration which fuels the rest of the book. Though it is a positive image, Orwell does slip some flaws in Old Major, such as how during his complaints about the abuse of animals he admits that he has been largely free from those terrors.
*Pinkeye — A small piglet who tastes Napoleon's food for poisoning.
*Piglets — While not truly noted in the novel, these piglets are hinted to be the children of Napoleon, and are the first generation of animals to actually be subjugated to his idea of animal inequality.

===The humans===
*[[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]] — The original owner of Manor Farm. He is probably based on [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]].
*[[Frederick (Animal Farm)|Mr. Frederick]] — The tough owner of Pinchfield, a well-kept neighbouring farm. He is probably based on [[Germany]] and/or [[Adolf Hitler]].
*[[Pilkington (Animal Farm)|Mr. Pilkington]] — The easy-going but crafty owner of Foxwood, a neighbouring farm. He represents [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and/or [[Winston Churchill]].
*Mr. Whymper — A human whom Napoleon hires to represent Animal Farm in human society. He is loosely based on [[George Bernard Shaw]] who visited the USSR in 1931 and praised what he found.

===The other animals===
*[[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] — Possibly one of the more popular characters, Boxer is the tragic avatar of the working class, or [[proletariat]]: loyal, dedicated, and strong. His major flaw, however, is his blind trust of the leaders and his inability to see corruption. He is used and abused by the pigs as much or more than he was by Jones. His death serves to show just how far the pigs are willing to go. A strong and loyal [[draft horse]], Boxer played a huge part in keeping the Farm together prior to his death. Boxer could also represent a [[Stakhanovite]]. His name is a reference to the [[Boxer Rebellion]] 
*Clover — Boxer's close friend, and also a draft horse. She blames herself for forgetting the original [[Seven Commandments]] when Squealer revises them. She represents the middle class educated people who acquiesce to the subversion of principles by the powerful.
*Mollie — A horse who likes wearing ribbons (which represent luxury) and being pampered by humans. She represents upper-class people, the [[Bourgeoisie]] who fled from the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R]] after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].
*Benjamin — A [[donkey]] who is cynical about the revolution. He is said to be inspired by Orwell himself. He represented the skeptical people in and out of Russia who believed that [[communism]] would not help the people of Russia
*Moses — A tame [[raven]] who spreads stories of Sugarcandy Mountain, the &quot;animal heaven&quot;. These beliefs are denounced by the pigs. Moses represents religion (specifically the Russian Orthodox Church), which has always been in conflict with [[communism]]. It is interesting to note that, while Moses initially leaves the farm after the rebellion, he later returns and is supported by the pigs. This represents the cynical use of religion by the state to anaesthetise the minds of the masses.  
*Muriel — A [[goat]] who reads the edited commandments. She may represent intelligent labour.
*Jessie and Bluebell — Two dogs who give birth in Chapter III. Their puppies are nurtured by Napoleon to inspire fear, without doubt representing the formation of the [[NKVD]]/[[KGB]].
*The Hens — Represent the [[Kulaks]], landed [[peasants]] persecuted by [[Stalin]]. 
*The Dogs — Napoleon's secret police and bodyguards (inspired by Cheka, NKVD, OGPU, MVD)
*The Sheep — The sheep show the dumb, animal following of the proletariats in the midst of the Russian Civil War (“Four legs good, two legs bad!”).

== Significance==
The book is an [[allegory]] about the events following the revolution in the [[Soviet Union]], and in particular the rise of [[Stalinism]] and the betrayal of the revolution which basically replaced one dictatorship for another. 

Orwell wrote the book following his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]] which are described in another of his books, ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.  He intended it to be a strong condemnation of what he saw as the [[Stalinist]] corruption of the original [[socialism|socialist]] ideals, in which he believed and continued to believe after he saw a revolution betrayed, as in Spain.  For the preface of a Ukrainian edition he prepared in 1947, Orwell describes what gave him the idea of setting the book on a farm&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/essays/ukrainian-af-pref.htm Preface to the Ukrainian Edition of Animal Farm]&lt;/ref&gt;.

:..I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge cart-horse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.

This Ukrainian edition was an early propaganda use of the book.  It was printed to be distributed among the soviet citizens of Ukraine who were just some of the many millions of [[displaced persons]] throughout Europe at the end of the Second World War.  The American occupation forces did not appreciate these illegal presses, printing propaganda, and confiscated 1,500 copies of ''Animal Farm'', handing them to the Soviet authorities.  The politics in the book also affected Britain, with Orwell reporting that [[Ernest Bevin]] was &quot;terrified&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Letter to [[Herbert Read]], [[18 August]], [[1945]].&lt;/ref&gt; that it may cause embarrassment if published before the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]].

In recent years the book has been used to compare new movements that overthrow heads of a corrupt and undemocratic government or organization, only to become corrupt and oppressive themselves over time as they succumb to the trappings of power and begin using violent and dictatorial methods to keep it. Such analogies have been used for many former African colonies such as [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], whose succeeding African-born rulers were thought to be as corrupt as the European colonists they supplanted.

In schools Animal Farm is used in the [[Core Knowledge]] curriculum. Core knowledge is based on the interaction of different subjects in schools. The way Animal Farm comes into play is that if a student's Geography or History Class is learning about the former Soviet Union, the English class will be reading Animal Farm.

==Post-publication views of the book==
In the post-[[World War Two|War]] years it became apparent to Orwell that anti-Russian literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch — including his regular publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. One publisher he sought to sell his book to rejected it on the grounds of government advice — although it was later found that the civil servant who gave the order was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[spy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Orwell: The Life'', D.J. Taylor, 2003, ISBN 0-8050-7473-2)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Orwell originally prepared a preface on freedom of the press for the book which noted &quot;The sinister fact about literary [[censorship]] in England is that it is largely voluntary. ... [Things are] kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervened but because of a general tacit agreement that ‘it wouldn’t do’ to mention that particular fact.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orwell.ru/library/novels/Animal_Farm/english/efp_go The Freedom of the Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat [[irony|ironically]], the preface itself was censored and is not published with most copies of the book.

==Film versions==
The book was the basis of an animated feature [[film]] in 1955 (Britain's first full-length animated movie), directed by [[John Halas]] and [[Joy Batchelor]] and quietly commissioned by the American [[CIA]], which softened the theme of the story slightly by reducing the role of Moses, the character representing religion, and adding an epilogue, that occurs immediately after the novel's iconic concluding imagery is depicted, where the other animals successfully revolt against the pigs.

There was also a 1999 live action film directed by John Stephenson, with voices by [[Kelsey Grammer]] as Snowball, [[Patrick Stewart]] as Napoleon, and [[Ian Holm]] as Squealer. Despite a few differences (such as completely different songs and Jesse being the first to question the pigs), much of the plot is loyal to the book. The film diverges from the book with an additional epilogue in which Jesse and several animals escape and return years later to a post-Napoleon era Animal Farm. 

==Cultural references==
* [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[1977]] [[record album|album]] ''[[Animals (album)|Animals]]'' was partially inspired by Animal Farm. It categorises people as pigs, dogs, or sheep.
* In an episode of ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'' (&quot;Aunt Katie's Farm&quot;), Johnny, while dressed in a pig costume, goes crazy and yells, &quot;Four legs good! Two legs bad!&quot; over and over.
* Radical socialist rappers [[Dead Prez]] released a song called &quot;Animal in Man&quot; off their debut LP, ''[[Let's Get Free]]'', re-telling the story.
* A song off canadian band [[Protest the Hero]]'s debut CD [[A Calculated Use of Sound]], called &quot;Red Stars Over the Battle of the Cowshed&quot; is presumably a reference to Animal Farm

'''Amphibians''' ([[Class (biology)|class]] '''Amphibia''') are a [[taxon]] of [[animal]]s that include all [[tetrapod]]s (four-legged [[vertebrate]]s) that do not have [[amniotic sac|amniotic]] eggs. Amphibians (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''αμφις'' &quot;both&quot; and ''βιος'' &quot;life&quot;) generally spend part of their time on land, but they do not have the adaptations to an entirely terrestrial existence found in most other modern tetrapods ([[amniote]]s). There are about 5,950 described, living [[species]] of amphibians. The study of amphibians and [[reptile]]s is known as [[herpetology]]. 

== History of amphibians ==
[[Image:Salamandra salamandra CZ.JPG|thumb|226px|right|[[Fire Salamander]] (''Salamandra salamandra'')]]Amphibians developed with the characteristics of pharyngeal slits/[[gills]], a [[dorsal nerve cord]], a [[notochord]], and a post-anal tail at different stages of their life. They have persisted since the dawn of tetrapods 390 million years ago in the [[Devonian]] period, when they were the first four-legged animals to develop [[lung]]s. During the following [[Carboniferous]] period they also developed the ability to walk on land to avoid aquatic competition and [[predation]] while allowing them to travel from water source to water source. As a group they maintained the status of the dominant animal for nearly 75 million years. Throughout their history they have ranged in size from the 3 foot (90cm) long Devonian [[Ichthyostega]], to the slightly larger 5 foot (150cm) long [[Permian]] [[Eryops]], and down to the tiny ''[[Brachycephalus didactylus]]'' (Brazilian Gold Frog) and ''[[Eleutherodactylus iberia]]'' from [[Cuba]], with a total length of 9.6-9.8 millimeters (0.4 inches). Amphibians have mastered almost every climate on earth from the hottest deserts to the frozen arctic.

== Classification ==
[[Image:Caecilian.jpg|226px|thumb|right|[[Caecilian]] from the [[San Antonio]] zoo]]
Traditionally the amphibians are taken to include all [[tetrapod]]s that are not [[amniote]]s.  Recent amphibians all belong to a single subgroup of these, called the [[Lissamphibia]].  Recently there has been a tendency to restrict the class Amphibia to the Lissamphibia, i.e. to exclude tetrapods that are not more closely related to modern forms than they are to modern reptiles, birds, and mammals.

There are two [[ancient]], [[extinct]], [[Subclass (biology)|subclasses]]:

* Subclass [[Labyrinthodontia]] ([[paraphyletic]])
* Subclass [[Lepospondyli]]

Of the remaining modern subclass '''Lissamphibia''' there are three [[Order (biology)|order]]s:

* Order [[Anura]] ([[frog]]s and [[toad]]s) (in Superorder Salientia): 5,228 species
* Order [[Caudata]] or [[Urodela]] ([[salamander]]s): 552 species
* Order [[Gymnophiona]] or [[Apoda]] ([[caecilian]]s): 171 species

Authorities disagree on whether Salientia is a Superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. In effect Salientia includes all the Anura plus a single [[Triassic]] proto-frog species, ''[[Triadobatrachus massinoti]]''.  Practical considerations seem to favour using the former arrangement now.

== Reproduction ==
For the purpose of [[reproduction]] most amphibians are bound to [[fresh water]]. A few tolerate [[brackish water]], but there are no true [[sea water]] amphibians. Several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations (e.g., [[Eleutherodactylus]], the Pacific Platymantines, the Australo-Papuan microhylids, and many other tropical frogs), however, do not need any water whatsoever. They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and [[evolution]]ary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet [[tropical rainforest]]s and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, bypassing the [[tadpole]] stage entirely. Several species have also adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, but most of them still need water to lay their eggs. [[Symbiosis]] with single celled [[algae]] that lives in the jelly-like layer of the eggs has evolved several times. The larvae (tadpoles or polliwogs) breathe with exterior [[gill]]s. After hatching, they start to transform gradually into the adult's appearance. This process is called [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. Typically, the animals then leave the water and become terrestrial adults, but there are many interesting exceptions to this general way of reproduction.

The most obvious part of the amphibian metamorphosis is the formation of four legs in order to support the body on land. But there are several other changes:
* The gills are replaced by other [[Respiratory system|respiratory organ]]s, i.e. [[lung]]s.
* The skin changes and develops [[gland]]s to avoid [[dehydration]]
* The eyes get eyelids and adapt to vision outside the water
* An [[eardrum]] is developed to lock the middle [[ear]]
* In frogs and toads, the [[tail]] disappears

==Amphibian conservation==
{{main|decline in frog populations}}
[[Image:Bufo periglenes1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Golden toad]] of [[Monteverde]], [[Costa Rica]] was among the first casualties of amphibian declines. Formerly abundant, it was last seen in 1989.]]
Dramatic declines in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized [[extinction]], have been noted in the past two decades from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus perceived as one of the most critical threats to global [[biodiversity]]. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including [[habitat destruction]] and modification, over-exploitation, [[pollution]], [[introduced species]], [[climate change]], and disease.  However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and amphibian declines are currently a topic of much ongoing research.

'''Alaska''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[ə 'læ skə]}}) is the 49th [[U.S. state|state]] of the [[United States]]. It was admitted on [[January 3]], [[1959]]. The population of the state is 626,932, [[as of 2000]], according to the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 U.S. census]]. Alaska is most likely ranked the fourth smallest state population wise in the U.S. with Wyoming, Vermont, and by now North Dakota smaller than Alaska. The name &quot;Alaska&quot; is most likely derived from the [[Aleut]] word ''Alyeska'', meaning ''greater land'' as opposed to the Aleut word ''Aleutia,'' meaning ''lesser land''. To the Aleuts, this distinction was a linguistic variation distinguishing the ''mainland'' from an ''island''.

It is bordered by [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] and [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] to the east, the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the south, the [[Bering Sea]], [[Bering Strait]], and [[Chukchi Sea]] to the west, and the [[Beaufort Sea]] and the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north. Alaska is the largest state by area in the United States. It is larger in area than all but 18 of the world's nations.

==History==
{{main|History of Alaska}}

Alaska was first inhabited by humans who came across the [[Bering Land Bridge]]. Eventually, Alaska became populated by the [[Inupiaq]], [[Inuit]] and [[Yupik]] [[Eskimo]]s, [[Aleut]]s, and a variety of [[American Indians in the United States|American Indian]] groups. Most, if not all, of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas probably took this route and continued further south and east.

The first written accounts indicate that [[Russian colonization of the Americas|the first Europeans to reach Alaska came from Russia]]. [[Vitus Bering]] sailed east and saw [[Mount Saint Elias|Mt. St. Elias]]. The [[Russian-American Company]] hunted [[sea otter]]s for their fur. The colony was never very profitable, because of the costs of transportation.

At the urging of [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward|William Seward]], the [[United States Senate]] approved the [[Alaska purchase|purchase of Alaska]] from [[Russia]] for $7,200,000 (approximately $134,000,000 in 2005 dollars, adjusted for inflation[http://www.westegg.com/inflation/]) on [[9 April]] [[1867]], and the United States flag was raised on [[18 October]] of that same year (now called [[Alaska Day]]). Coincident with the ownership change, the de facto [[International Date Line]] was moved westward, and Alaska changed from the [[Julian calendar]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Therefore, for residents, Friday, [[October 6]], [[1867]] was followed by Friday, [[October 18]], [[1867]]; two Fridays in a row because of the date line shift.

The first American administrator of Alaska was [[Poles|Polish]] immigrant [[Wlodzimierz Krzyzanowski|Włodzimierz Krzyżanowski]]. The purchase was not popular in the contiguous United States, where Alaska became known as &quot;Seward's Folly&quot; or &quot;Seward's Icebox.&quot;  Alaska celebrates the purchase each year on the last Monday of [[March]], calling it [[Seward's Day]]. After the purchase of Alaska between 1867 and 1884 the name was changed to the Department of Alaska.  Between 1884 and 1912 it was called the district of Alaska.
{{lastfrontier}}
President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed the [[Alaska Statehood Act]] into [[United States law]] on [[7 July]] [[1958]] which paved the way for Alaska's admission into the Union on [[January 3]] [[1959]].

Alaska suffered one of the worst [[earthquake]]s in recorded North American history on [[Good Friday]] 1964 (see [[Good Friday Earthquake]]).

In 1976, the people of Alaska amended the state's constitution, establishing the [[Alaska Permanent Fund]]. The fund invests a portion of the state's mineral revenue, including revenue from the [[Trans-Alaskan Pipeline System]], &quot;to benefit all generations of Alaskans.&quot; In March 2005, the fund's value was over $30 billion.

Prior to 1983, the state lay across four different [[time zone]]s&amp;mdash;Pacific Standard Time (UTC -8 hours) in the southeast panhandle, a small area of Yukon Standard Time (UTC -9 hours) around [[Yakutat]], Alaska&amp;ndash;Hawaii Standard Time (UTC -10 hours) in the [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] vicinity, with the [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] area and most of the [[Aleutian Islands]] observing Bering Standard Time (UTC -11 hours).  In 1983 the number of time zones was reduced to two, with the entire mainland plus the inner Aleutian Islands going to UTC -9 hours (and this zone then being renamed Alaska Standard Time as the [[Yukon Territory]] had several years earlier (circa 1975) adopted a single time zone identical to Pacific Standard Time), and the remaining Aleutian Islands were slotted into the UTC &amp;minus;10 hours zone, which was then renamed Hawaii&amp;ndash;Aleutian Standard Time.

Over the years various [[vessel]]s have been named [[USS Alaska|USS ''Alaska'']], in honor of the state.

During [[World War II]] three of the outer Aleutian Islands&amp;mdash;[[Attu Island|Attu]], [[Agattu]] and [[Kiska]]&amp;mdash;were occupied by [[Japan|Japanese]] troops. It was the only territory within the current borders of the United States to have land occupied during the war.

==Politics==
Alaska is often characterized as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-leaning state with strong [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] tendencies. Local political communities often work on issues related to land use development, [[fishing]], [[tourism]], and [[individual rights]] as many residents are proud of their rough Alaskan heritage.

[[Alaska Native|Alaska Natives]], while organized in and around their communities, are often active within the [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations|Native corporations]] which have been given ownership over large tracts of land, and thus need to deliberate resource conservation and development issues.

In presidential elections, the state's Electoral College votes have been most often won by a Republican nominee. Only once has Alaska supported a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, when it supported [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the landslide year of 1964, although the 1960 and 1968 elections were close. No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times. President [[George W. Bush]] won the state's electoral votes in 2004 by a margin of 25 percentage points with 61.1% of the vote.  Juneau stands out as an area that supports Democratic candidates.

When the [[United States Congress]], in 1957 and 1958, debated the wisdom of admitting it as the 49th state, much of the political debate centered on whether Alaska would become a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-leaning state. Conventional wisdom had it that, with its rugged individualism, penchant for new ideas, and dependence on the [[Federal Government]] largess for basic needs, it would become a Democratic stronghold, about which Republicans, and the, then, Republican Administration of [[Dwight Eisenhower]] had reservations. Given time, those fears proved roundly unfounded. After an early flirtatious period with liberal politics, the political climate of Alaska changed quickly once [[petroleum]] was discovered and the federal government came to be seen as 'meddling' in local affairs. Still, despite its libertarian leanings, the state regularly takes in more federal money than it gives out, a fact that can be attributed at least partially to its equal representation in the [[United States Senate]].     

In recent years, the [[Alaska Legislature]] is a 20-member Senate serving 4-year terms and 40-member House serving 2-year terms. It has been dominated by conservatives, generally Republicans. Likewise, recent state governors have been mostly conservatives, although not always elected under the official 'Party' banner. Republican [[Walter Joseph Hickel|Wally Hickel]] was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after jumping the Republican ship and briefly joining the [[Alaskan Independence Party]] ticket just long enough to be reelected. He subsequently officially 'rejoined' the Republican fold in 1994. 

Alaska's members of the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] are all Republican. U.S. Senator [[Ted Stevens]] was appointed to the position following the death of U.S. Senator [[Bob Bartlett]] in December of 1968, and has never lost a re-election campaign since. As the longest-serving Republican in the Senate (some political wits call him Senator-For-Life), Stevens has been a crucial force in gaining Federal money for his state.

Until his resignation from the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] to run for Governor, Republican [[Frank Murkowski]] held the state's other Senatorial position and, as Governor, was allowed to appoint his daughter, [[Lisa Murkowski]] as his successor. She won a full six-year term on her own in 2004.

Alaska's sole [[U.S. House of Representatives|U.S. House]] Representative, [[Don Young]] won re-election to his 17th-straight term, also in 2004. His seniority in House ranks him as one of the most influential Republican House members. His position on the House Transportation Committee allowed him to parlay some $450 million to two bridge projects in Alaska, named the ''[[Bridges to Nowhere]]'', for which he gained national notoriety following the devastation in the State of [[Louisiana]] following [[Hurricane Katrina]] and his insistence that the money not be returned to aid in rebuilding the Gulf Coast.

==Geography==
[[image:Looking back to Little Port Walter - NOAA.jpg|thumb|250px|Near [[Little Port Walter]]]]
Alaska is one of the two states that is not bordered by another US state, [[Hawaii]] being the other. It is the only state that is both in [[North America]] and is not part of the 48 contiguous states; about 500 miles (800 kilometers) of [[Canada|Canadian]] territory separate Alaska from Washington. Therefore, Alaska is an [[exclave]] of the United States that is part of the continental U.S. but is not part of the contiguous U.S. It is also the only mainland state whose [[capital city]] is accessible only via [[Water transportation|ship]] or [[aviation|air]]. There are no [[road]]s connecting Juneau to the rest of the state.

Alaska is the largest state in the United States in terms of land area, 570,374 square miles (1&amp;nbsp;477&amp;nbsp;261 km²). If a map of Alaska were superimposed upon a map of the [[Continental United States]], Alaska would overlap [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], [[New Mexico]] and [[Colorado]]. Alaska has the longest [[coastline]] of any state.

One scheme for describing the state's geography is by labeling the regions:
*[[South Central Alaska]] is the southern coastal region and is the population center for the state. The Municipality of Anchorage and many small but growing towns, such as [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]], and [[Wasilla, Alaska|Wasilla]], lie within this area. [[Petroleum]] industrial plants, transportation, [[tourism]], and two [[military base]]s form the core of the economy here.
*The [[Alaska Panhandle]], also known as Southeast Alaska, is home to Juneau, many small towns, tidewater [[glacier|glaciers]] and extensive forests. Tourism, fishing, forestry and state government anchor the economy.
*The [[Alaska Interior]] is home to [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]]. The geography is marked by large [[braided river]]s, such as the [[Yukon River]] and the [[Kuskokwim River]], as well as [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] lands and shorelines.
*The [[Alaskan Bush]] is the remote, less crowded part of the state, encompassing 380 native villages and small towns such as [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]] and, most famously, [[Barrow, Alaska|Barrow]], the northernmost town in the United States.

The northeast corner of Alaska is covered by the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]], which covers 19,049,236 acres (79,318 km²).

With its numerous islands, Alaska has nearly 34,000 miles (54&amp;nbsp;700 km) of tidal shoreline. The island chain extending west from the southern tip of the [[Alaska Peninsula]] is called the [[Aleutian Islands]]. Many active [[volcano]]es are found in the Aleutians. For example, [[Unimak Island]] is home to [[Mount Shishaldin]], a moderately active volcano that rises to 9,980 ft (3042&amp;nbsp;m) above [[sea level]]. The chain of volcanoes extends to [[Mount Spurr]], west of Anchorage on the mainland.

North America's second largest [[tide]]s occur in [[Turnagain Arm]] just south of Anchorage, which often sees tidal differences of more than 35 feet (10.7&amp;nbsp;m).

Alaska is home to 3.5 million [[lake]]s of 20 acres (8&amp;nbsp;ha) or larger. [[Marshland]]s and wetland [[permafrost]] cover 188,320 square miles (487&amp;nbsp;747&amp;nbsp;km², mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands. Frozen water, in the form of [[glacier]] ice, covers  some 16,000 square miles (41&amp;nbsp;440&amp;nbsp;km²) of land and 1200 square miles (3108&amp;nbsp;km²) of tidal zone. The Bering Glacier complex near the southeastern border with [[Yukon]], [[Canada]], covers 2250 square miles (5827&amp;nbsp;km²) alone.

{{ussm|alaska.png|ak}}
The Aleutian Islands actually cross longitude 180°, also making it the easternmost state, although the [[International Date Line]] doglegs around them to keep the whole state in the same day. It is part of the [[extreme points of the United States]].

According to the October 1998 report of the [[United States Bureau of Land Management]], approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the [[United States Federal Government|U.S. Federal Government]] as [[national forest]]s, [[national park]]s, and [[national wildlife refuge]]s. Of these, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] manages 87 million acres (350&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;km²), or 23.8% of the state. The [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] is managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]].

Of the remaining land area, the State of Alaska owns 24.5%; another 10% is managed by thirteen regional and dozens of local Native corporations created under the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]]. Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling less than 1%.

==Boroughs and census areas==
Alaska has no [[county (United States)|counties]] in the sense used in the rest of the country. Instead, the state is divided into [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|27 census areas and boroughs]]. The difference between [[borough]]s and census areas is that boroughs have an organized area-wide government, while census areas are artificial divisions defined by the [[United States Census Bureau]] for statistical purposes only. Areas of the state not in organized boroughs compose what the government of Alaska calls the [[unorganized borough]]. Borough-level government services in the unorganized borough are provided by the state itself.

==Economy==
[[Image:wiki_alaska.jpg|thumb|350px|Greetings from Alaska]]
The state's 2003 total gross state product was $31 billion. Its ''per-capita'' income for 2003 was $33,213, 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the nation. Alaska's main export is seafood. Agriculture represents only a fraction of the Alaska economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere. Employment is primarily in government and industries such as [[natural resource]] extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in both Fairbanks and Anchorage. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and [[tourism]] sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.

The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states. This has changed for the most part in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], where the cost of living is actually less than some major cities in the Lower 48, thanks to lower housing and transportation costs. The introduction of big-box stores in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau also did much to lower prices. However, rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods, compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure. Many rural residents come in to these cities and purchase food and goods in bulk from warehouse clubs like [[Costco]] and [[Sam's Club]]. Some have embraced the free shipping offers of some online retailers to purchase items much more cheaply than they could in their own communities, if they are available at all.

==Transportation==
[[image:Alaska Highway Bridge.jpg|thumb|234px|Bridge on [[Alaska Highway]] between [[Watson Lake]] and [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]].]]
Alaska is arguably the least-connected state in terms of road transportation. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the [[Alaska Highway]], the principal route out of the state through [[Canada]]. The state capital, [[Juneau]], is not accessible by road, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system. One unique feature of the road system is the [[Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel]], which links the [[Seward Highway]] south of Anchorage with the relatively isolated community of [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]]. The tunnel held the title of the longest road tunnel in North America (at nearly 2.5 miles [4&amp;nbsp;km]) until completion of the 3.5 mile (5.6km) [[Interstate 93]] tunnel as part of the &quot;[[Big Dig]]&quot; project in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. The Anderson Tunnel combines a one-lane roadway and train tracks in the same housing. Consequently, eastbound traffic, westbound traffic, and the [[Alaska Railroad]] must share the tunnel, resulting in waits of 20 minutes or more to enter.  As reflected on the Alaska Department of Transportation [http://www.dot.state.ak.us/creg/whittiertunnel/index.shtml Tunnel Website], it is now considered &quot;North America's longest railroad-highway tunnel.&quot;

The [[Alaska Railroad]] runs from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] through [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Denali]], and [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] to [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]], with spurs to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] and [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]]. The railroad is famous for its summertime passenger services but also plays a vital part in moving Alaska's natural resources, such as coal and gravel, to ports in Anchorage, Whittier and Seward. The Alaska Railroad is the only remaining railroad in North America to use [[caboose]]s on its freight trains. A stretch of the track along an area inaccessible by road serves as the only transportation to cabins in the area.

Most cities and villages in the state are accessible only by sea or air. Alaska has a well-developed [[ferry]] system, known as the [[Alaska Marine Highway]], which serves the cities of [[Southeast Alaska|Southeast]] and the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. The system also operates a ferry service from [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], [[Washington]] up the [[Inside Passage]] to [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]]. Cities not served by road or sea can only be reached by air, accounting for Alaska's extremely well-developed [[Alaskan Bush|Bush]] air services&amp;mdash;an Alaskan novelty.

Anchorage itself, and to a lesser extent Fairbanks, are serviced by [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport#Airlines and destinations|many major airlines]]. Air travel is the cheapest and most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]] to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (unofficial sources have estimated the numbers for 2004 at some four million tourists arriving in Alaska between May and September).

However, regular flights to most villages and towns within the state are commercially challenging to provide. Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger [[Boeing 737]]-200s) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]], [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities. The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines like: [[Era Aviation]], [[Peninsula Airways|PenAir]], and [[Frontier Flying Service]]. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered Bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the [[Cessna Caravan]], the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities. But perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the Bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is [[Lake Hood Seaplane Base|Lake Hood]], located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and lots of items from stores and warehouse clubs.

Another Alaskan transportation method is the [[dogsled]]. In modern times, dog [[mushing]] is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the [[Iditarod]], a 1,150-mile (1850&amp;nbsp;km) trail from Anchorage to Nome. The race commemorates the famous [[1925 serum run to Nome]] in which mushers and dogs like [[Balto]] took much-needed medicine to the [[diphtheria]]-stricken community of [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash prizes and prestige.

As of 2005, Alaska has an estimated population of 663,661, which is an increase of 5,906, or 0.9%, from the prior year and an increase of 36,730, or 5.9%, since the year 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 36,590 people derived from its 53,132 births of which 16,542 deaths is subtracted from, and an increase due to net migration of 1,181 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 5,800 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 4,619 people.

Alaska is the least densely populated state.

===Race and ancestry===
The racial breakdown of the state is:
*67.6% [[Whites|White]] (Non-Hispanic)
*15.6% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] or [[Alaska Native]]
*4.1% [[Hispanic American|Hispanic]]
*4% [[Asian American|Asian]]
*3.5% [[Blacks|Black]]
*5.4% [[Mixed race]]

The largest ancestry groups in the state are: [[German-American|German]] (16.6%), Alaska Native or American Indian (15.6%), [[Ireland|Irish]] (10.8%), [[British American|English]] (9.6%), [[United States|American]] (5.7%), and [[Norwegian-American|Norwegian]] (4.2%). Alaska has the largest percentage of American Indians (16%) of any state.

The vast, sparsely populated bush regions of northern and western Alaska are primarily inhabited by Alaska Natives, and they also have a large presence in the southeast. Anchorage, Fairbanks, and other parts of south-central and southeast Alaska have many whites of northern and western European ancestry. The Wrangell-Petersburg area has many residents of Scandinavian ancestry and the Aleutians have many Filipinos. Most of the state's black population lives in Anchorage.

[[As of 2000]], 85.7% of Alaska residents age 5 and older speak [[English language|English]] at home and 5.2% speak [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speakers make up 2.9% of the population, followed by [[Tagalog]] speakers at 1.5% and [[Korean language|Korean]] at 0.8%.

===Religion===
*[[Christianity|Christian]] &amp;ndash; 81%
**[[Protestantism|Protestant]] &amp;ndash; 68%
***[[Baptist]] &amp;ndash; 11%
***[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] &amp;ndash; 8%
***[[Methodism|Methodist]] &amp;ndash; 6%
***[[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] &amp;ndash; 2%
***[[Episcopal]] &amp;ndash; 1%
***[[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] &amp;ndash; 1%
**[[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] &amp;ndash; 8%
**[[Roman Catholicism in the United States|Catholic]] &amp;ndash; 7%
**[[Latter-day Saint]] &amp;ndash; 1%
*Other [[religion]]s &amp;ndash; 1%
*Not religious/[[agnosticism|agnostic]] &amp;ndash; 17%

Notable is Alaska's relatively large [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christianity|Christian]] population, a result of early [[Russia]]n colonization and [[missionary]] work among indigenous Alaskans.

==Social issues==
Alaska has long had a problem with alcohol use and abuse. Many rural communities in Alaska have outlawed its import. &quot;Dry&quot;, &quot;wet&quot;, and &quot;damp&quot; are terms describing a community's laws on liquor consumption. This problem directly relates to Alaska's high rate of [[Fetal Alcohol Syndrome]] (FAS) as well as contributing to the high rate of suicides. This is a controversial topic for many residents.

Alaska has also had a problem with &quot;[[brain drain]]&quot; as many of its young people, including most of the highest academic achievers, leave the state upon graduating high school. While for many this functions as a sort of [[walkabout]], many do not return to the state. The [[University of Alaska]] has been successfully combating this by offering four-year scholarships to the top 10 percent of Alaska high school graduates, the Alaska Scholars Program.

[[Domestic abuse]] and other violent crimes are also at notoriously high levels in the state; this is in part linked to alcohol abuse.

==Notable Alaskans==
The [[National Statuary Hall]] of the United States of America is part of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Each state has selected one or two distinguished citizens and provided statues. Alaska's are of its first two senators:
* [[Bob Bartlett|Edward Lewis &quot;Bob&quot; Bartlett]] (1904&amp;ndash;1968) was the territorial delegate to the US Congress from 1944 to 1958, and was elected as the first senior [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] in 1958 and re-elected in 1964. There are streets, buildings, and even the first state ferry, named for him.
* [[Ernest Gruening]] (1886&amp;ndash;1974) was appointed Governor of the [[Alaska Territory|Territory of Alaska]] in 1939, and served in that position for fourteen years. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1958 and re-elected in 1962.
* [[Jay Hammond]] (1922&amp;ndash;2005) was Governor during the building of the [[Alaska Pipeline]] and established the [[Alaska Permanent Fund]], providing Alaskans with essentially free money. He is regarded as somewhat of a hero because of this. He was also governor during passage of the [[Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act]] and effectively served to moderate associated issues within the state among disparate interest groups ranging from conservationists to natives to pro-development interests.
* [[Fran Ulmer]] was the first woman elected to statewide office&amp;mdash;she became Lieutenant Governor in 1994.
* [[George Sharrock]] (1910&amp;ndash;2005) moved to the territory before statehood, eventually elected as the mayor of Anchorage and served during the [[Good Friday Earthquake]] in March 1964. This was the most devastating earthquake to hit Alaska and it sunk beach property, damaged roads and destroyed buildings all over the south central area. Sharrock, sometimes called the &quot;earthquake mayor,&quot; led the city's rebuilding effort over six months.

==Important cities and towns==
Alaska's most populous city is [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], home of 260,283 people, 225,744 of whom live in the urbanized area. It ranks third in the [[List of U.S. cities by area]], behind two other Alaskan cities. Sitka ranks as America's largest city by area, followed closely by Juneau.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In modern usage, architecture is the [[art]] of creating an actual, implied or apparent plan of any complex [[object]] or [[system]]. The term can be used to connote the ''implied architecture'' of abstract things such as [[music]] or [[mathematics]], the apparent architecture of natural things, such as [[geology|geological]] formations or the [[structural biology|structure of biological cells]], or explicitly ''planned architectures'' of human-made things such as [[Computer software|software]], [[computers]], [[enterprise]]s, and [[database]]s, in addition to buildings. In every usage, an architecture may be seen as a ''subjective [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]'' from a human perspective (that of the 'user' in the case of abstract or physical artifacts) to the [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] or [[components]] of some kind of [[structure]] or system, which preserves the relationships among the elements/components.

'''Architecture''' may refer to:

* [[Architecture|Architecture (built environment)]], the art and science of designing habitations, buildings, and building complexes; classical architecture.
*  [[Architectural history]] studies the evolution and history of (built) architectures across the world through a consideration of various influences- [[artistic]], [[cultural]], [[political]], [[economic]], and [[technological]].
* [[Architecture (other)]], a representation of an arbitrary abstract, natural, or man-made structure of two or more interacting parts (e.g., architecture of mathematics, architecture of language, cytoarchitecture, cellular architecture, naval architecture, skelletal architecture, battlefield architecture).  All [[systems]] can be said to have an architecture.
* [[Biological architectures]], the ''apparent'' architecture of biological structures. See [[cytoarchitecture]], [[structural biology]], [[cell (biology)|cell architecture]]
* [[Landscape architecture]], the design of man-made land constructs
* [[Systems architecture]], the representation of an engineered (or To Be Engineered) system, and the process and discipline for effectively implementing the design(s) for such a system. Such a system may consist of information and/or hardware and/or software.
* [[Computer architecture]], the systems architecture of a computer.
* [[Software architecture]], the systems architecture of a software system. 
* [[Enterprise architecture]], a systems architecture, or framework,  for aligning an organization's structure/ processes/ information/ operations/  projects with the organization's overall strategy 
* [[Information architecture]], a systems architecture for structuring a knowledge-based system
* [[Product design]], or product architecture, the systems design of a product or product family
* [[Vehicle architecture]], an automobile platform made from a set of components common to a number of different vehicles

'''Agriculture''' is the process of producing [[food]], [[feed]], [[fiber]] and many other desired products by the cultivation of certain [[plant]]s and the raising of domesticated [[animal]]s ([[livestock]]). The practice of agriculture is also known as &quot;[[farming]]&quot;, while scientists, inventors and others devoted to improving farming methods and implements are also said to be engaged in agriculture.

More [[Person|people]] in the [[world]] are involved in agriculture as their primary [[economics|economic activity]] than in any other, yet it only accounts for four percent of the world's [[gross domestic product|GDP]].&lt;!--Source?--&gt;

==Overview==
[[Image:Agriculture---Rice.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Tea]] plantation in [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]

Agriculture sometimes refers to  [[subsistence farming|subsistence agriculture]], the production of enough [[food]] to meet just the needs of the farmer/[[agriculturalist]] and his/her family. It may also refer to industrial agriculture, (often referred to as [[factory farming]]) long prevalent in developed nations and increasingly so elsewhere, which consists of obtaining financial income from the cultivation of land to yield [[produce]], the commercial raising of animals ([[animal husbandry]]), or both.

Agriculture is also short for the ''study'' of the practice of agriculture&amp;mdash;more formally known as [[agricultural science]]. Agricultural students are known (sometimes derisively) as &quot;Aggies&quot;.

Increasingly, in addition to food for humans and [[fodder|animal feeds]], agriculture produces goods such as cut [[flower]]s, ornamental and [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] plants, [[timber]] or lumber, [[fertilizer]]s, [[animal hides]], [[leather]], industrial chemicals ([[starch]], [[sugar]], [[ethanol]], [[alcohol]]s and [[plastic]]s), [[fiber]]s ([[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], and [[flax]]), fuels ([[methane]] from [[biomass]], [[biodiesel]]) and both legal and illegal drugs ([[biopharmaceutical]]s, [[tobacco]], [[marijuana]], [[opium]], [[cocaine]]). [[GMO|Genetically engineered]] plants and animals produce specialty drugs.

In the [[Western world]], the use of [[genetic modification|gene manipulation]], better management of soil nutrients, and improved [[weed control]] have greatly increased yields per unit area. At the same time, the use of mechanization has decreased labour requirements. The developing world generally produces lower yields, having less of the latest science, [[capital (economics)|capital]], and technology base.

Modern agriculture depends heavily on engineering and technology and on the biological and physical sciences. [[Irrigation]], [[drainage]], [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and sanitary engineering, each of which is important in successful farming, are some of the fields requiring the specialized knowledge of agricultural engineers.

Agricultural chemistry deals with other vital farming concerns, such as the application of fertilizer, insecticides (see [[Pest control]]), and fungicides, soil makeup, analysis of agricultural products, and nutritional needs of farm animals.[[Plant breeding]] and genetics contribute additionally to farm productivity. Advanced seed engineering has allowed strains of seed to become perfect in every farming situation. Seeds can now germinate faster and adapt to shorter growing seasons in different climates. Present-day seed can resist the spraying of pesticides that kill all green-leaf plants. [[Hydroponics]], a method of soilless gardening in which plants are grown in chemical nutrient solutions, may help meet the need for greater food production as the world's population increases.

The packing, processing, and marketing of agricultural products are closely related activities also influenced by science. Methods of quick-freezing and dehydration have increased the markets for farm products (see [[Food preservation]]; [[Meat packing industry]]).

Mechanization, the outstanding characteristic of late [[19th century|19th]] and [[20th century]] agricultural evolution, has eased much of the backbreaking toil of the farmer. More significantly, mechanization has enormously increased farm efficiency and productivity (see [[Agricultural machinery]]). Animals, including horses, mules, oxen, camels, llamas, alpacas, and dogs; however, are still used to cultivate [[field (agriculture)|fields]], harvest [[crops]] and transport farm products to markets in many parts of the world.

Airplanes, helicopters, trucks and tractors are used in agriculture for seeding, spraying operations for insect and disease control, [[Aerial topdressing]], transporting perishable products, and fighting forest fires. Radio and television disseminate vital weather reports and other information such as market reports that concern farmers. Computers have become an essential tool for farm management.

[[Image:Farming-on-Indonesia.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Farming, ploughing rice paddy, in [[Indonesia]].]]

According to the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in the US, agricultural mechanization is one of the 20 greatest engineering achievements of the 20th century. Early in the century, it took one American farmer to produce food for 2.5 people, where today, due to engineering technology (also, [[plant breeding]] and [[agrichemical]]s), a single farmer can feed over 130 people [http://www.greatachievements.org/greatachievements/ga_7_2.html]. This comes at a cost, however, of large amounts of energy input, from unsustainable, mostly [[fossil fuel]], sources.

Animal husbandry means breeding and raising animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, eggs, or wool) on a continual basis.

In recent years some aspects of industrial [[intensive agriculture]] have been the subject of increasing discussion. The widening [[sphere of influence]] held by large seed and chemical companies, meat packers and food processors has been a source of concern both within the farming community and for the general public. There has been increased activity of some people against some farming practices, raising chickens for food being one example. Another issue is the type of feed given to some animals that can cause [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy]] in cattle. There has also been concern because of the disastrous effect that intensive agriculture has on the environment. In the US, for example, fertilizer has been running off into the Mississippi for years and has caused a dead spot in the Gulf of Mexico, where the Mississippi empties. Intensive agriculture also depletes the fertility of the land over time and the end effect is that which happened in the Middle East, were some of the most fertile farmland in the world was turned into a desert by intensive agriculture.

The patent protection given to companies that develop new types of [[seed]] using [[genetic engineering]] has allowed seed to be licensed to farmers in much the same way that computer software is licensed to users. This has changed the balance of power in favor of the seed companies, allowing them to dictate terms and conditions previously unheard of. Some argue these companies are guilty of [[biopiracy]].

[[Soil]] [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and [[nutrient management]] have been important concerns since the [[1950s]], with the best farmers taking a [[stewardship]] role with the land they operate. However, increasing contamination of waterways and wetlands by nutrients like [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] are of concern in many countries.

Increasing consumer awareness of agricultural issues has led to the rise of  [[community-supported agriculture]], [[local food movement]], [[Slow Food|slow food]], and commercial [[organic farming]], though these yet remain fledgling industries.

==History==
[[Image:Ancient egyptian farmer.gif|thumb|230px|Ancient Egyptian farmer]]

: ''Main article: [[History of agriculture]]''

[[Paleoethnobotany|Archaeobotanists]]/[[Paleoethnobotany|Paleoethnobotanists]] have traced the selection and cultivation of specific food plant characteristics, such as a semi-tough [[rachis]] and larger [[seeds]], to just after the [[Younger Dryas]] (about 9,500 BC) in the early [[Holocene]] in the [[Levant]] region of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. Limited [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence both indicate a [[cereal|grain]]-[[grinding]] [[culture]] [[farming]] along the [[Nile]] in the [[10th millennium BC]] using the world's earliest known type of [[sickle]] [[blade]]s. There is even earlier evidence for conscious cultivation and seasonal harvest: grains of [[rye]] with domestic traits have been recovered from [[Epi-Palaeolithic]] (10,000+ BC) contexts at [[Abu Hureyra]] in [[Syria]], but this appears to be a localised phenomenon resulting from cultivation of stands of wild rye, rather than a definitive step towards domestication. It is not until ca. 8,500 BC, in middle-Eastern cultures referred to as [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]]), where there is the first definite evidence for the emergence of a widespread subsistence economy that was dependent on domesticated plants and animals. In these contexts lie the origins of the eight so-called [[Neolithic founder crops|founder crops]] of agriculture: firstly [[emmer wheat]], [[einkorn wheat]], then hulled [[barley]], [[pea]], [[lentil]], [[bitter vetch]], [[chick pea]] and [[flax]]. These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]] sites in this region, although the consensus is that [[wheat]] was the first to be sown and harvested on a significant scale. There are many sites that date to between ca. 8,500 BC and 7,500 BC where the systematic farming of these crops contributed the major part of the inhabitants' diet. From the [[Fertile Crescent]] agriculture spread eastwards to [[Central Asia]] and westwards into [[Cyprus]], [[Anatolia]] and, by 7,000 BC, [[Greece]]. Farming, principally of emmer and einkorn, reached northwestern [[Europe]] via southeastern and central Europe by ca. 4,800 BC (see, among others, Price, D. [ed.] 2000. ''Europe's First Farmers''. Cambridge University Press; Harris, D. [ed.] 1996 ''The Origins and Spread of Agriculture in Eurasia''. UCL Press).
[[Image:Agriculture (Plowing) CNE-v1-p58-H.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A [[tractor]] [[plough]]ing an [[alfalfa]] field]]

The reasons for the earliest introduction of farming may have included [[climate]] change, but possibly there were also social reasons (e.g. accumulation of food surplus for competitive gift-giving). Most certainly there was a gradual transition from [[hunter-gatherer]] to agricultural economies after a lengthy period when some crops were deliberately planted and other foods were gathered from the wild. Although localised climate change is the favoured explanation for the origins of agriculture in the [[Levant]], the fact that farming was 'invented' at least three times, possibly more, suggests that social reasons may have been instrumental. In addition to emergence of farming in the [[Fertile Crescent]], agriculture appeared by at least 6,800 BC in East Asia ([[rice]]) and, later, in [[Mesoamerica|Central]] and [[South America]] ([[maize]], [[squash (fruit)|squash]]). Small scale agriculture also likely arose independently in early Neolithic contexts in [[India]] (rice) and [[Southeast Asia]] (taro).&lt;!--Sources?--&gt;

[[Image:ClaySumerianSickle.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Sumer]]ian Harvester's sickle, [[3000 BCE]]. Baked clay. [[Field Museum]].]]

Full dependency on domestic crops and animals (i.e. when wild resources contributed a nutritionally insignificant component to the diet) was not until the [[Bronze Age]]. If the operative definition of ''agriculture'' includes large scale intensive cultivation of land, [[mono-cropping]], organised [[irrigation]], and use of a specialized [[labour (economics)|labour]] force, the title &quot;inventors of agriculture&quot; would fall to the [[Sumer]]ians, starting ca. 5,500 BC. Intensive farming allows a much greater density of population than can be supported by hunting and gathering and allows for the accumulation of excess product to keep for winter use or to sell for profit. The ability of farmers to feed large numbers of people whose activities have nothing to do with material production was the crucial factor in the rise of standing armies. The agriculturalism of the Sumerians allowed them to embark on an unprecedented territorial expansion, making them the first [[empire]] builders. Not long after, the Egyptians, powered by effective farming of the [[Nile|Nile valley]], achieved a population density from which enough warriors could be drawn for a territorial expansion more than tripling the Sumerian empire in area.&lt;!--Sources?--&gt;

The invention of a [[three field system]] of crop rotation during the [[Middle Ages]] vastly improved agricultural efficiency.

After [[1492]] the world's agricultural patterns were shuffled in the widespread exchange of plants and animals known as the [[Columbian Exchange]].&lt;!--Is this just Crosby's term or is it more widely used?--&gt; Crops and animals that were previously only known in the Old World were now transplanted to the New and vice versa. Perhaps most notably, the [[tomato]] became a favorite in European cuisine, while certain wheat strains quickly took to western hemisphere soils and became a dietary staple even for native North, Central and South Americans.

By the early [[1800]]s agricultural practices, particularly careful selection of hardy strains and cultivars, had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the Middle Ages and before, especially in the largely virgin lands of North and South America. With the rapid rise of [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization]] in the 20th century, especially in the form of the [[tractor]], the demanding tasks of [[sowing]], [[harvesting]] and [[threshing]] could be performed with a speed and on a scale barely imaginable before. These advances have led to efficiencies enabling certain modern farms in the United States, Argentina, Israel, Germany and a few other nations to output volumes of high quality produce per land unit at what may be the practical limit.

===Crop improvement===
[[Image:Cropscientist.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An agricultural scientist records corn growth]]
[[Image:Bird netting.jpg|thumb|250px|Netting protecting wine grapes from birds]]
*''See main article on'' [[Plant breeding]]

Domestication of plants is done in order to increase yield, improve disease resistance and drought tolerance, ease harvest and to improve the taste and [[nutrition]]al value and many other characteristics. Centuries of careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant breeders use greenhouses and other techniques to get as many as three generations of plants per year so that they can make improvements all the more quickly.

Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and '30s improved [[pasture]] (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive radiation mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the [[1950s]] produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn and barley.&lt;!--Source?--&gt;

For example, average yields of corn ([[maize]]) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (40 bushels per acre) in [[1900]] to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in [[2001]], primarily due to improvements in genetics. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in [[1900]] to more than 2.5 t/ha in [[1990]]. [[South America]]n average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, [[Africa]]n under 1 t/ha, [[Egypt]] and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as [[France]] is over 8 t/ha. Higher yields are due to improvements in genetics, as well as use of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical [[pest control]], growth control to avoid lodging).&lt;!--Sources?--&gt; [Conversion note: 1 bushel of wheat = 60 pounds (lb) ≈ 27.215 kg. 1 bushel of corn = 56 pounds ≈ 25.401 kg]

In industrialized agriculture, crop &quot;improvement&quot; has often reduced nutritional and other qualities of food plants to serve the interests of producers.  After mechanical tomato-harvesters were developed in the early 1960s, agricultural scientists bred tomatoes that were harder and less nutritious (Friedland and Barton 1975).  In fact, a major longitudinal study of nutrient levels in numerous vegetables showed significant declines in the last 50 years; garden vegetables in the U.S. today contain on average 38 percent less vitamin B2 and 15 percent less vitamin C (Davis and Riordan 2004).

Very recently, [[genetic engineering]] has begun to be employed in some parts of the world to speed up the selection and breeding process. The most widely used modification is a herbicide resistance gene that allows plants to tolerate exposure to glyphosate, which is used to control weeds in the crop. A less frequently used but more controversial modification causes the plant to produce a toxin to reduce damage from insects (c.f. [[Transgenic maize|Starlink]]).

There are specialty producers who raise less common types of livestock or plants.

[[Aquaculture]], the farming of [[fish]], [[shrimp]], and [[algae]], is closely associated with agriculture.

[[Beekeeping|Apiculture]], the culture of bees, traditionally for [[honey]]&amp;mdash;increasingly for crop [[pollination]].

==Environmental problems==
Agriculture may often cause environmental problems because it changes natural environments and produces harmful by-products. Some of the negative effects are:

* [[Nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] surplus in [[river]]s and [[lake]]s.
* Detrimental effects of [[herbicide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s, and other [[biocide]]s.
* Conversion of natural [[ecosystem]]s of all types into [[arable land]].
* Consolidation of diverse [[biomass]] into a few species.
* [[Erosion]]
* Depletion of [[minerals]] in the [[soil]]
* [[Particulate matter]], including [[ammonia]] and [[ammonium]] off-gasing from animal waste contributing to [[air pollution]]
* [[Weed]]s - [[feral]] plants and animals
* Odor from agricultural [[waste]]
* [[Soil salination]] .

==Policy==
[[Agricultural policy]] focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include:
*[[Foodborne illness|Food safety]]: Ensuring that the food supply is free of contamination.
*[[Food security]]: Ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs.
*[[Food quality]]: Ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality.

* Conservation
* Environmental impact
* Economic stability

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aldous Leonard Huxley''' ([[July 26]], [[1894]] &amp;ndash; [[November 22]], [[1963]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[writer]] who emigrated to the [[United States]]. He was a member of the famous [[Huxley family]] who produced a number of brilliant scientific minds. Best known for his [[novel]]s and wide-ranging output of [[essay]]s, he also published [[short stories]], [[poetry]], [[travel writing]], and [[film]] stories and scripts. Through his novels and essays Huxley functioned as an examiner and sometimes critic of social mores, societal norms and ideals, and possible misapplications of science in [[human]] [[life]]. While his earlier concerns might be called &quot;[[humanist]],&quot; ultimately, he became quite interested in &quot;spiritual&quot; subjects like [[parapsychology]] and [[mysticism|mystically]] based [[philosophy]], which he also wrote about. By the end of his life, Huxley was considered, in certain circles, a 'leader of modern thought'.

==Biography==
 
===Early years===
[[Image:Huxley-Arnold family tree.png|thumb|right|Family tree]]
Huxley was born in [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]], [[England]]. He was the son of the [[writer]] [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]] by his first wife, [[Julia Arnold]]; and grandson of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], one of the most important naturalists of the 19th Century, a man known as &quot;Darwin's Bulldog.&quot; His brother [[Julian Huxley]] was a [[biology|biologist]] also noted for his [[evolution|evolutionary]] theories. Huxley understandably excelled in the areas he took up professionally, for on his father's side were a number of noted men of [[science]], while on his mother's were people of [[literature|literary]] accomplishment. 

Huxley was a lanky, delicately framed child who was gifted intellectually. His father was a professional [[herbalist]] as well as an author, so Aldous began his learning in his father's well-equipped [[botanical]] [[laboratory]], then continued in a school named Hillside, which his mother supervised for several years until she became terminally ill. From the age of nine, Aldous was then educated in the British [[boarding school]] system. He took readily to the handling of ideas. 

His mother Julia died in [[1908]], when Aldous was only fourteen, and his sister Roberta died of an unrelated incident in the same month. Three years later Aldous suffered an illness ([[Keratitis|keratitis punctata]]) which seriously damaged his eyesight. His older brother Trev committed [[suicide]] in 1914. Aldous's near-[[blindness]] disqualified him from service in [[World War I]]. Once his eyesight recovered, he was able to read [[English literature]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], where he was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]].

Maturing as a lean young man well over six feet in height, the cerebrotonic Huxley's initial interest in literature was primarily intellectual. While he was noted for his personal kindliness, only considerably later (some say under the influence of such friends as [[D.H. Lawrence]]) did he heartily embrace ''feelings'' as matters of importance in his evolving personal philosophy and literary expression.

Following his education at [[Balliol]], Huxley was financially indebted to his father and had to earn a living. For a short while in [[1918]], he was employed acquiring provisions at the [[Air Ministry]]. But never desiring a career in administration (or in business), Huxley's lack of inherited means propelled him into applied literary work.

Huxley had completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of seventeen and began writing seriously in his early twenties. He wrote great novels on dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'', and on [[pacifism|pacifist]] themes (e.g. ''[[Eyeless in Gaza]]''). Huxley was strongly influenced by [[F. Matthias Alexander]] and included him as a character in ''Eyeless in Gaza''.

===Middle years===
Already a noted [[satire|satirist]] and social thinker, during [[World War I]], Huxley spent much of his time at [[Garsington Manor]], home of Lady [[Ottoline Morrell]]. Later, in ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' ([[1921]]) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. He married Maria Nys, whom he had met at Garsington. They had one child, Matthew, who grew up to be an [[epidemiologist]].

Huxley moved to [[Hollywood, California| Hollywood]], [[California]] in [[1937]] with his wife and friend [[Gerald Heard]]. Heard introduced Huxley to [[Vedanta]] and [[meditation|meditating]]. In Huxley's 1937 book ''Ends and Means'', most people in modern civilization agree that they want a world of 'liberty, peace, justice, and brotherly love', though they haven't been able to agree on how to achieve it. His book goes on to explore why the confusion or disagreement is there and what might be done about it.

In [[1938]] Huxley befriended [[J. Krishnamurti]], whose teachings he greatly admired. He also became a [[Vedantist]] in the circle of [[Swami]] [[Swami Prabhavananda | Prabhavananda]], and he also introduced [[Christopher Isherwood]] to this circle. Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, ''The Perennial Philosophy'', which discussed teachings of the world's great mystics.

For most of his life since the illness in his teens which left Huxley nearly blind, his eyesight was poor (despite the partial recovery which had enabled him to study at Oxford). Around 1939 he heard of the [[Bates Method]] for [[Natural Vision Improvement]], and of a teacher (Margaret Corbett) who was able to teach him in the method. He claimed his sight improved dramatically as a result of using the method, then later wrote a book about it (The Art of Seeing) which was published in 1942 (US), 1943 (UK). He reported that for the first time in over 25 years, he was able to read without [[glasses|spectacles]] and without strain. He was a [[screenwriter]] for the [[1940]] production of [[Pride and Prejudice]].

===Later years===
After World War II Huxley applied for [[United States]] citizenship, but was denied because he would not say he would take up arms to defend America. He became a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. Thereafter, his works were strongly influenced by [[mysticism]] and his experiences with the [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drug]] [[mescaline]], to which he was introduced by the psychiatrist [[Humphry Osmond]] in [[1953]]. His years on psychoactive drugs were described as a paradise, washed down with [[bourbon]], generally. He was a pioneer of self-directed psychedelic drug use in a search for enlightenment, famously taking 100 micrograms of [[LSD]] as he lay dying. Huxley's [[psychedelic]] [[Recreational drug use|drug]] experiences are described in the essays ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (the title deriving from some lines in the book ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' by [[William Blake]]) and ''[[Heaven and Hell (essay)|Heaven and Hell]]''. The title of the former became the inspiration for the naming of the [[Rock (music)|rock]] band, [[The Doors]]. Some of his writings on psychedelics became frequent reading among early [[hippies]].

Huxley's main interest was not in just ''anything'' vague, mysterious, or subjective, but in what is sometimes termed &quot;higher mysticism&quot;; he liked the term &quot;[[perennial philosophy]]&quot; that he used as the title of his noted book on the topic. During the 1950s, Huxley's interest in the related field of [[psychical research]] grew keener.

Huxley's wife, Maria, died of [[breast cancer]] in [[1955]], and in [[1956]] he remarried, to [[Laura Huxley|Laura Archera]], who was herself an author and who wrote a [[biography]] of Aldous. In [[1960]], Huxley was diagnosed with [[laryngeal cancer|throat cancer]]. In the years that followed, with his health deteriorating, he wrote the utopian novel ''[[Island (novel)|Island]]'', and gave lectures on &quot;Human Potentialities&quot; at the [[Esalen]] institute. In [[1959]] Huxley, who remained a [[British Citizen]], turned down an offer of a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[Harold_MacMillan#Government|Macmillan government]].

His ideas were foundational to the forming of the [[Human Potential Movement]]. He was also invited to speak at several prestigious American universities. At a speech given in [[1961]] at the California Medical School in [[San Francisco]], Huxley warned: &quot;There will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless [[concentration camp]] for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it,&quot; an idea not dissimilar to his contemporary writer [[J. B. Priestley]]'s idea in [[The Magicians]].

Huxley's views on the proper roles of science and technology (as he portrayed these, say, in ''Island'') are akin to some other noted English and American thinkers of the twentieth century, such as [[Lewis Mumford]] and Huxley's friend [[Gerald Heard]] (and, in some ways, [[Buckminster Fuller]] and [[E.F. Schumacher]]). Clearly, these men found descendants in some significant movers of a younger generation, e.g., [[Stewart Brand]].

Via Gerald Heard, Huxley was introduced to the young [[Huston Smith]], who went on to become a prolific and famous scholar on the religions of man. The two friends acquianted Smith with Vedanta and meditative practice. Later, while Huxley was a guest professor at [[M.I.T.]], he made introductions between Smith and [[Timothy Leary]] that lead to epiphanies Smith covers in his later book, ''Cleansing of the Doors of Perception''.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591810086]&lt;/sup&gt;

Amongst humanists, Huxley was considered an intellectual's intellectual. Although his financial circumstances had forced him to churn out articles and books, his thinking and ''best'' writing earned him an exalted esteem. His books were frequently on the required reading lists of English and modern philosophy courses in American colleges and universities. He was one of the twentieth-century thinkers honoured in the Scribners Publishing's &quot;Leaders of Modern Thought&quot; series (a volume of biography and literary criticism by Philip Thody, ''Aldous Huxley'').

===Death and afterwards===
On his deathbed, unable to speak, he made a written request to his wife for &quot;[[LSD]], 100 [[microgram|µg]], [[Intramuscular injection|i.m.]]&quot; She obliged, and he died peacefully the following morning, [[November 22]], [[1963]]. Media coverage of his death was overshadowed by news of the [[assassination of President John F. Kennedy]], which occurred on the same day, as did the death of the [[Ireland|Irish]] author [[C. S. Lewis]].

In all of Huxley's mature writings, one finds an awareness that seems to bridge the gap between &quot;[[The Two Cultures]]&quot; &amp;ndash; the [[sciences]] and the [[humanities]]. This gulf posed a potentially enormous problem, one that was recognized by other thinkers during Huxley's lifetime, such as [[C.P. Snow]]. The interest among professors of humanities and [[liberal arts]] in Huxley's work, both during the writer's lifetime and afterwards, rests on this consciousness on the part of the author, and of course on the artful and often humorous way in which he expressed himself.

Huxley's [[satirical]], [[dystopia]]n, and [[utopia]]n novels seldom fail to stimulate thought. The same may be said for his essays and essay collections. Perhaps his main message is the tragedy that frequently follows from [[egocentrism]], self-centredness, and selfishness.

==Films==

Huxley wrote many [[screenplay]]s, and many of his novels were later adapted for film or [[television]]. 

Notable works include the original screenplay for [[The_Walt_Disney_Company|Disney]]'s animated ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', two productions of ''[[Brave New World]]'', one of ''[[Point Counter Point]]'', one of ''[[Eyeless in Gaza]]'', and one of ''[[Ape and Essence]]''. He was one of the screenwriters for the 1940 version of ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 movie)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' and co-wrote the screenplay for the 1944 version of ''[[Jane Eyre (1944 movie)|Jane Eyre]]'' with [[John Houseman]].  Director [[Ken Russell]]'s [[1971]] film ''[[The Devils (film)|The Devils]]'', starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]], is adapted from Huxley's ''[[The Devils of Loudun]]'', and a 1990 made-for-television film adaptation of ''Brave New World'' was directed by [[Burt Brinckeroffer]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about an organism. See [[algae programming language]] for a [[programming language]] in [[computing]].''
[[Image:Laurencia.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A seaweed (''Laurencia'') up close: the &quot;branches&quot; are multicellular and only about 1 mm thick. Much smaller algae are seen growing attached to the structure extending upwards in the lower right quarter]]
'''Algae''' (singular ''alga'') encompass several different groups of living organisms that capture light energy through [[photosynthesis]], converting inorganic substances into simple sugars using the captured energy.  Algae have been traditionally regarded as simple [[plant]]s, and some are closely related to the [[embryophyte|higher plant]]s.  Others appear to represent different [[protist]] groups, alongside other organisms that are traditionally considered more animal-like (that is, [[protozoa]]).  Thus algae do not represent a single evolutionary direction or line, but a level of organization that may have developed several times in the early history of life on earth.

Algae range from single-celled organisms to multi-cellular organisms, some with fairly complex differentiated form and (if marine) called [[seaweed]]s. All lack [[leaf|leaves]], [[root]]s, [[flower]]s, and other organ structures that characterize higher plants.  They are distinguished from other [[protozoa]] in that they are [[autotrophic|photoautotrophic]], although this is not a hard and fast distinction as some groups contain members that are [[mixotrophic]], deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by [[osmotrophy]], [[myzocytosis|myzotrophy]], or [[phagocytosis|phagotrophy]]. Some unicellular species rely entirely on external energy sources and have reduced or lost their photosynthetic apparatus.

All algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from the [[cyanobacteria]], and so produce [[oxygen]] as a by-product of photosynthesis, unlike non-cyanobacterial photosynthetic bacteria.

Algae are usually found in damp places or bodies of water and thus are common in terrestrial as well as aquatic environments.  However, terrestrial algae are usually rather inconspicuous and far more common in moist, tropical regions than dry ones, because algae lack vascular tissues and other adaptions to live on land. Algae can endure dryness and other conditions in symbiosis with a fungus as [[lichen]]. 

The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology.  Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column&amp;mdash;called '''[[phytoplankton]]'''&amp;mdash;provide the food base for most marine [[food chain]]s. In very high densities (so-called [[algal bloom]]s) these algae may discolor the water and outcompete or poison other life forms.  [[Seaweed]]s grow mostly in shallow marine waters. Some are used as human food or harvested for useful substances such as [[agar]] or fertilizer.  The study of algae is called [[phycology]] or algology.

== Relationships among algal groups ==
=== Prokaryotic algae ===
Traditionally the [[cyanobacteria]] have been included among the algae, referred to as the ''cyanophytes'' or ''Blue-green Algae'', (the term &quot;algae&quot; refers to any aquatic organisms capable of photosynthesis)[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanolh.html], though some recent treatises on algae specifically exclude them.  [[Cyanobacteria]] are some of the oldest organisms to appear in the [[fossil record]], dating back about 3.8 billion years ([[Precambrian]]). Ancient cyanobacteria likely produced much of the [[oxygen]] in the Earth's atmosphere.  

[[Cyanobacteria]] can be unicellular, colonial, or filamentous. They have a [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cell structure typical of bacteria and conduct photosynthesis directly within the [[cytoplasm]], rather than in specialized organelles. Some filamentous [[blue-green algae]] have specialized cells, termed heterocysts, in which [[nitrogen fixation]] occurs.
[http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e42/42a.htm]

=== Eukaryotic algae ===
All other algae are [[eukaryote]]s and conduct photosynthesis within membrane-bound structures (organelles) called [[chloroplast]]s.  Chloroplasts contain DNA and are similar in structure to cyanobacteria, presumably representing reduced cyanobacterial [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbionts]].  The exact nature of the chloroplasts is different among the different lines of algae, reflecting different endosymbiotic events.  There are three groups ([[Archaeplastida]]) that have ''primary'' chloroplasts:

* [[Green alga]]e, together with [[embryophyte|higher plant]]s
* [[Red alga]]e
* [[Glaucophyte]]s

In these groups, the chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes and probably developed through a single endosymbiosis.  The chloroplasts of red algae have a more or less typical cyanobacterial pigmentation, while those of the green alga have chloroplasts with chlorophyll ''a'' and ''b'', the latter found in some cyanobacteria and not most.  Higher plants are pigmented similarly to green algae and probably developed from them.

Two other groups of algae have green chloroplasts containing chlorophyll ''b'': 

* [[Euglenid]]s and 
* [[Chlorarachniophyte]]s.  

These are surrounded by three and four membranes, respectively, and were probably retained from an ingested green alga.  Those of the chlorarchniophytes contain a small nucleomorph, which is the remnant of the alga's [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].  It has been suggested that the euglenid chloroplasts only have three membranes because they were acquired through [[myzocytosis]] rather than [[phagocytosis]].

The remaining algae all have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls ''a'' and ''c''.  The latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts, but genetic similarities with the red algae suggest a relationship there.  These groups include:

* [[Heterokont]]s (e.g., golden algae, diatoms, brown algae)
* [[Haptophyte]]s (e.g., coccolithophores)
* [[Cryptomonad]]s
* [[Dinoflagellate]]s

In the first three of these groups ([[Chromista]]), the chloroplast has four membranes, retaining a nucleomorph in cryptomonads, and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor.  The typical dinoflagellate chloroplast has three membranes, but there is considerable diversity in chloroplasts among the group, as some members have acquired theirs from different sources.  The [[Apicomplexa]], a group of closely related parasites, also have [[plastid]]s though not actual chloroplasts, which appear to have a common origin with those of the dinoflagellates.

Note many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic.  Some retain plastids, but not chloroplasts, while others have lost them entirely.

== Forms of algae ==
Most of the simpler algae are unicellular [[flagellate]]s or [[amoeboid]]s, but colonial and non-motile forms have developed independently among several of the groups.  Some of the more common organizational levels, more than one of which may occur in the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of a species, are:

* ''Colonial'' - small, regular groups of motile cells
* ''Capsoid'' - individual non-motile cells embedded in [[mucilage]]
* ''Coccoid'' - individual non-motile cells with cell walls
* ''Palmelloid'' - non-motile cells embedded in mucilage
* ''Filamentous'' - a string of non-motile cells connected together, sometimes branching
* ''Parenchymatous'' - cells forming a [[thallus (tissue)|thallus]] with partial differentiation of tissues

In three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached, leading to organisms with full tissue differentiation.  These are the [[brown alga]]e&amp;mdash;some of which may reach 70 m in length ([[kelp]]s)&amp;mdash;the [[red alga]]e, and the [[green alga]]e. The most complex forms are found among the green algae (see [[Charales]]), in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants.  The point where these non-algal plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers, a characteristic not found in the other alga groups.

== Algae and symbioses==
Some species of algae form [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]] with other organisms. In these symbioses, the algae supply photosynthates (organic substances) to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells. The host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the alga. Examples include:
* ''lichens'' - a fungus is the host, usually with a green alga or a cyanobacterium as its symbiont. Both fungal and algal species found in lichens are capable of living independently, although habitat requirements may be greatly different from those of the lichen pair. 
* ''corals'' - algae known as [[zooxanthella]]e are symbionts with [[coral]]s. Notable amongst these is the dinoflagellate ''Symbiodinium'', found in many hard corals. The loss of ''Symbiodinium'', or other zooxanthellae, from the host is known as [[coral bleaching]].
* ''sponges'' -

== Uses of algae ==
Algae are used by man in a great many ways. Because many species are aquatic and microscopic, they are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds. [[Algae culture]] on a large scale is an important type of [[aquaculture]] in some places.  

===Energy source===
*Algae can be used to produce [[biodiesel]] (see [[algae culture#biodiesel production|algae culture]]), and by some estimates can produce vastly superior amounts of oil, compared to terrestrial crops grown for the same purpose.  Because algae grown to produce biodiesel does not need to meet the requirements of a food crop, it is much cheaper to produce.  Also it does not need fresh water or fertilizer (both of which are quite expensive).
*Algae can be grown to produce [[hydrogen]].  In 1939 a German researcher named [[Hans Gaffron]], while working at the University of Chicago, observed that the algae he was studying, [[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]] (a green-algae), would sometimes switch from the production of oxygen to the production of hydrogen.[http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,54456,00.html]  Gaffron never discovered the cause for this change and for many years other scientists failed in their attempts at its discovery.  In the late 1990's professor [[Anastasios Melis]] a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley discovered that if you deprive the algae of sulfur it will switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis), to the production of hydrogen.  He found that the [[enzyme]] responsible for this reaction is [[hydrogenase]], but that the hydrogenase will not cause this switch in the pressence of oxygen.  Melis found that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted its internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen. [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5]  [[Chlamydomonas moeweesi]] is also a good strain for the production of hydrogen.
*Algae can be grown to produce [[biomass]], which can be burned to produce heat and electricity.

===Pollution control===
* Algae are used in wastewater treatment facilities, reducing the need for more dangerous chemicals. 
* Algae can be used to capture [[fertilizers]] in runoff from farms.  If this algae is then harvested, it itself can be used as fertilizer.
* Algae are used by some powerplants to reduce CO2 [[emissions]][http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2006-01-10-algae-powerplants_x.htm]. The CO2 is pumped into a pond, or some kind of tank, on which the algae feed.

===Nutritional value of algae===
*Algae is commercially cultivated as a nutritional supplement. One of the most popular [[microalgal]] species is [[Spirulina]] (Arthrospira platensis), which is a [[Cyanobacteria]] (known as blue-green algae), and has been hailed by some as a superfood. [http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/algae.htm]Other algal species cultivated for their nutritional value include; [[Chlorella]] (a green algae), and [[Dunaliella]] (Dunaliella salina), which is high in [[beta-carotene]] and is used in vitamin C supplements.
*Algae is sometimes also used as a food, as in the Chinese &quot;vegetable&quot; known as ''[[fat choy (vegetable)|fat choy]]'' (which is actually a [[cyanobacterium]]).
*The oil from some algae have high levels of unsaturated fatty acids.  [[Arachidonic acid]](a polyunsaturated fatty acid), is very high in [[parietochloris incisa]], (a green algae) where it reaches up to 47% of the triglyceride pool (Bigogno C et al. Phytochemistry 2002, 60, 497).

[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~rdb/opa-g137.html www.cfsan.fda.gov] FDA on algal-oil use in food products

The natural [[pigment]]s produced by algae can be used as an alternative to chemical [[dyes]] and coloring agents.  [http://www.bgu.ac.il/bgn/Microalgae.html]  Many of the paper products used today are not recyclable because of the chemical inks that they use, paper recyclers have found that inks made from algae are much easier to break down.  There is also much interest in the food industry into replacing the coloring agents that are currently used with coloring derived from algal pigments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[statistics]], '''analysis of variance''' ('''ANOVA''') is a collection of [[statistical model]]s and their associated procedures which compare means by splitting the overall observed [[variance]] into different parts.  The initial techniques of the analysis of variance were pioneered by the [[statistician]] and [[geneticist]] [[Ronald Fisher]] in the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]], and is sometimes known as '''Fisher's ANOVA''' or '''Fisher's analysis of variance'''.

==Overview==

There are three conceptual classes of such models:
*Fixed-effects model assumes that the data come from [[normal distribution|normal populations]] which differ in their means.
*Random-effects models assume that the data describe a hierarchy of different populations whose differences are constrained by the hierarchy.
*Mixed models describe situations where both fixed and random effects are present.

The fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total sum of squares into components related to the effects in the model used. For example, we show the model for a simplified ANOVA with one type of treatment at different levels. (If the treatment levels are quantitative and the effects are linear, a [[linear regression]] analysis may be appropriate.)

: &lt;math&gt;SS_{\hbox{Total}} = SS_{\hbox{Error}} + SS_{\hbox{Treatments}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The number of [[degrees of freedom]] (abbreviated ''df'') can be partitioned in a similar way and specifies the [[chi-square distribution]] which describes the associated sums of squares.

: &lt;math&gt;df_{\hbox{Total}} = df_{\hbox{Error}} + df_{\hbox{Treatments}}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Fixed-effects model ==

The fixed-effects model of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter has subjected his experimental material to several treatments, each of which affects only the mean of the underlying normal distribution of the &quot;response variable&quot;.

== Random-effects model ==

Random effects models are used to describe situations in which incomparable differences in experimental material occur. The simplest example is that of estimating the unknown mean of a population whose individuals differ from each other. In this case, the variation between individuals is ''confounded'' with that of the observing instrument.

== Degrees of freedom ==

Degrees of freedom indicates the effective number of observations which contribute to the sum of squares in an ANOVA, the total number of observations minus the number of linear constraints in the data.

== Tests of significance ==

Analyses of variance lead to tests of [[statistical significance]] using [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]]'s [[F-distribution]].

:''For [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] [[hydrocarbon]]s containing one or more rings, see [[Cycloalkane]].''

An '''alkane''' in [[organic chemistry]] is a [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] [[hydrocarbon]] without cycles, that is, an acyclic [[hydrocarbon]] in which the [[molecule]] has the maximum possible number of [[hydrogen]] atoms and so has no [[double bond]]s. Alkanes are [[aliphatic]] compounds.

The general formula for alkanes is '''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+2&lt;/sub&gt;'''; the simplest possible alkane is therefore [[methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The next simplest is [[ethane]], C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;; the series continues indefinitely.  Each carbon atom in an alkane has sp³ [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridization]].

Alkanes are also known as [[Paraffin|paraffins]], or collectively as the ''paraffin series''. These terms also used for alkanes whose carbon atoms form a single, unbranched chain. Such branched-chain alkanes are called ''[[isoparaffins]]''.

==Isomerism==
The atoms in alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in multiple ways, forming different [[isomer]]s. &quot;Normal&quot; alkanes have a linear, unbranched configuration. The number of isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms; for  alkanes with 1 to 12 carbon atoms, the number of isomers equals 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 18, 35, 75, 159, and 355, respectively {{OEIS|id=A000602}}.

==Nomenclature of alkanes==
The names of all alkanes end with '''-ane'''.

===Alkanes with unbranched carbon chains===
The first four members of the series (in terms of number of carbon atoms) are named as follows:
:[[methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
:[[ethane]], C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
:[[propane]], C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
:[[butane]], C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
Alkanes with [[five]] or more carbon atoms are named by adding the [[suffix]] '''-ane''' to the appropriate [[IUPAC numerical multiplier|numerical multiplier]] with elision of a terminal ''-a-'' from the basic numerical term. Hence, [[pentane]], C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;; [[hexane]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;; [[heptane]], C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;; [[octane]], C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;; etc. For a more complete list, see [[List of alkanes]].

Straight-chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix ''n-'' (for ''normal'') to distinguish them from branched-chain alkanes having the same number of carbon atoms. Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers: e.g. [[hexane|''n''-hexane]] is a [[neurotoxin]] while its branched-chain isomers are not.

===Alkanes with branched carbon chains===
Branched alkanes are named as follows:

* Identify the longest straight chain of carbon atoms.

* Number the atoms in this chain, starting from 1 at one end and counting upwards to the other end.

* Examine the groups attached to the chain in order and form their names.

* Form the name by looking at the different attached groups, and writing, for each group, the following:
** The number, or numbers, of the carbon atom, or atoms, where it is attached.
** The prefixes ''di-'', ''tri-'', ''tetra-'', etc. if the group is attached in 2, 3, 4, etc. places, or nothing if it is attached in only one place.
** The name of the attached group.

* The formation of the name is finished by writing down the name of the longest straight chain.

To carry out this algorithm, we must know how to name the substituent groups.  This is done by the same method, except that instead of the longest chain of carbon atoms, the longest chain starting from the attachment point is used; also, the numbering is done so that the carbon atom next to the attachment point has the number 1.

For example, the compound
[[image:isobutane.png]]
is the only 4-carbon alkane possible, apart from butane.  Its formal name is 2-methylpropane.

Pentane, however, has two branched isomers, in addition to its linear, normal form:

[[image:dimethylpropane.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
2,2-dimethylpropane

and

[[image:2-methylbutane.png]] &lt;br /&gt;
2-methylbutane.

===Trivial names===
The following nonsystematic names are retained in the IUPAC system:
:[[isobutane]] for 2-methylpropane
:[[isopentane]] for 2-methylbutane
:[[neopentane]] for 2,2-dimethylpropane
The name ''isooctane'' is very widely used in the [[Petrochemistry|petrochemical industry]] to refer to [[2,2,4-trimethylpentane]].

==Occurrence==
&lt;!-- Translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:Jupiter.jpg|thumb|right|Methane and ethane make up a large proportion of Jupiter's atmosphere]]
Alkanes occur both on [[Earth]] and in the solar system, however only the first hundred or so, and even then mostly only in traces. The light hydrocarbons, especially [[methane]] and [[ethane]] for example, have been detected both in the tail of the comet [[Hyakutake]] and in some [[meteorite]]s such as [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s. They also form an important portion of the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]] of the outer gas planets [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. On [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the satellite of Saturn, it is believed that there were once large oceans of these and longer chain alkanes: smaller seas of liquid ethane are thought still to exist there.

Traces of methane (about 0.0001% or 1 ppm) occur in the Earth's atmosphere, produced primarily by forms of [[Archaea]]. The content in the oceans is negligible due to the low solubility in water: however, at high pressures and low temperatures, methane can co-crystallize with water to form a solid [[methane hydrate]]. Although they cannot be commercially exploited at the present time, the calorific value of the known methane hydrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together&amp;mdash;methane extracted from methane hydrate is considered therefore a candidate for future fuels.

[[Image:Oil well3419.jpg|thumb|right|Extraction of alkanes in Ontario]]
Today, the most important commercial sources for alkanes are clearly [[natural gas]] and [[Petroleum|oil]], which are the only [[organic compound]]s to occur as minerals in nature. Natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane, with some [[propane]] and [[butane]]: oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons. Both were formed when dead marine animals and plants (zooplankton and phytoplankton) sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an anoxic environment (ie lacking in oxygen) and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form. Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 3CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
These hydrocarbons collected in porous rocks, trapped beneath an impermeable cap rock. In contrast to methane, which is constantly reformed in large quantities, higher alkanes rarely develop to a considerable extent in nature. The present deposits will not be reformed once they are exhausted.

Solid alkanes occur as [[evaporation]] residues from oil, known as [[tar]]. One of the largest natural deposits of solid alkanes is in the [[asphalt]] lake known as the [[Pitch Lake]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

==Purification and use==
&lt;!-- Translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:ShellMartinez.jpg|thumb|right|An [[oil refinery]] at [[Martinez]], [[California]].]]
Alkanes are both important raw materials of the chemical industry and the most important fuels of the world economy.

The starting materials for the processing are always [[natural gas]] and [[crude oil]]. The latter is separated in an [[oil refinery]] by [[fractional distillation]] and processed into many different products, for example [[gasoline]]. The different &quot;fractions&quot; of crude oil have different boiling points and can be isolated and separated quite easily: within the individual fractions the boiling points lie closely together.

The domain of usage of a certain alkane can be determined quite well according to the number of  carbon atoms, although the following demarcation is idealized and not perfect. The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes, and in some countries for electricity generation. [[Methane]] and [[ethane]] are the main componants of natural gas; they are normally stored as gases under pressure. It is however easier to transport them as liquids: this requires both compression and cooling of the gas.

[[Propane]] and [[butane]] can be liquefied at fairly low pressures, and are well known as '''liquified petroleum gas (LPG)'''. Propane, for example, is used in the propane gas burner, butane in disposable cigarette lighters (where the pressure is a mere 2 [[bar (unit)|bar]]). The two alkanes are used as propellants in [[aerosol spray]]s.

From [[pentane]] to [[octane]] the alkanes are highly volatile liquids. They are used as fuels in [[internal combustion engine]]s, as they vaporise easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets which would impair the unifomity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred, as they are much less prone to premature ignition which causes [[Engine knocking|knocking]] than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition is measured by the [[octane rating]] of the fuel, where [[2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (''isooctane'') has an arbitrary value of 100 and [[heptane]] has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances.

Alkanes from [[nonane]] to, for instance, [[hexadecane]] (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher [[viscosity]], less and less suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of [[diesel]] and [[aviation fuel]]. Diesel fuels are charaterised by their [[cetane number]], cetane being an old name for hexadecane. However the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly.

Alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricating oil]]. In latter function they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as [[paraffin wax]], for example in [[candle]]s. This should not be confused however with true [[wax]], which consists primarily of [[ester]]s.

Alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in [[bitumen]], used for example in road surfacing. However the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by [[cracking]].

==Preparation==
Numerous ways exist to prepare alkanes in the laboratory. The most well known methods are [[hydrogenation]] of [[alkene]]s and [[hydrolysis]] of [[Grignard reagent]]s. Alkanes can also be prepared directly from [[alkyl halide]]s in the [[Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction]]. The [[Barton-McCombie deoxygenation]] removes hydroxyl groups from alcohols and the [[Clemmensen reduction]] removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes.

==Molecular geometry==
&lt;!-- Translated from [:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:Ch4-hybridisation.png|thumb|right|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridisation in [[methane]].]]
The molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics. It is derived from the [[electron configuration]] of [[carbon]], which has four [[valence electron]]s. The carbon atoms in alkanes are always [[Orbital hybidisation|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridised]], that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s-orbital and the three 2p-orbitals. These orbitals, which have identical energies, are arranged spatially in the form of a tetrahedron, the angle of 109.47° between them.

===Bond lengths and bond angles===
&lt;!-- Translated from [:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
An alkane molecule has only C&amp;ndash;H and C&amp;ndash;C single bonds. The former result from the overlap of a sp³-orbital of carbon with the 1s-orbital of a hydrogen; the latter by the overlap of two sp³-orbitals on different carbon atoms. The [[bond length]]s amount to 1.09×10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m for a C&amp;ndash;H bond and 1.54×10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m for a C&amp;ndash;C bond.
[[Image:Ch4-structure.png|thumb|right|The tetrahedral structure of methane.]]

The spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp³-orbitals&amp;mdash;they are tetrahedrally arranged, with an angle of 109.47° between them. Structural formulae which represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another, while both common and useful, do not correspond with the reality.

===Conformation===
&lt;!-- Translated from [:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
The structural formula and the [[bond angle]]s are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule. There is a further [[degree of freedom]] for each carbon&amp;ndash;carbon bond: the [[torsion angle]] between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond. The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its [[conformation]].

====Ethane====
&lt;!-- Translated from [:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Ethane]] forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C&amp;ndash;C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C&amp;ndash;C bond, then one will see the so-called [[Newman projection]]: The circle represents the two carbon atoms, one behind the other, and the bonds to hydrogen are represented by the straight lines. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon&amp;ndash;carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important:
[[Image:Newman_projection_ethane.png|thumb|right|200px|Newman projections of the two conformations of ethane: eclipsed on the left, staggered on the right.]]

* In the '''eclipsed conformation''', corresponding to a torsion angle of 0°, 120° or 240°, the hydrogen atoms attached to the front carbon are directly in front of those attached to the rear carbon.
* In the '''staggered conformation''', corresponding to a torsion angle of 60°, 180° or 300°, the hydrogen atoms attached to the front carbon are exactly in between those attached to the rear carbon.

The two conformations, also known as [[rotomer]]s, differ in energy: The staggered conformation is 12.6&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation. The explanation for this difference in energy has been the subject of debate, with two main theories predominating:
*in the eclipsed conformation, the electrostatic repulsion between the electrons in the carbon&amp;ndash;hydrogen bonds is maximised.
*in the staggered conformation, the [[hyperconjugation]] (a form of delocalisation) of the valence electrons is maximised.
These two explanations are not contradictory or exclusive; the latter is thought to be the more important for ethane itself.

This difference in energy between the two conformations, known as the [[torsion energy]], is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature. There is constant rotation about the C&amp;ndash;C bond, albeit with short &quot;pauses&quot; at each staggered conformation. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-group by 120° relative to the other, is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;seconds.

====Higher alkanes====
&lt;!-- Translated from [:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:Newman_projection_butane.png|thumb|right|400px|The four conformations of butane. From left to right: fully eclipsed, inclined, partially eclipsed, antiperiplanar.]]
The situation with respect to the two C&amp;ndash;C bonds in [[propane]] is qualitatively similar to that of ethane: it is more complex, however, for [[butane]] and higher alkanes.

If one takes the central C&amp;ndash;C bond of butane as the reference axis, each of the two central carbon atoms is bound to two hydrogen atoms and a methyl group. Four different conformations can be defined by the torsion angle between the two methyl groups and, as in the case of ethane, each has its characteristic energy.

*The '''fully eclipsed''' or '''synperiplanar''' conformation has a torsion angle of 0°. It is the configuration with the highest energy.

*The '''inclined''' conformation has a torsion angle of 60° (or 300°). It is a local energy minimum.

*The '''partially eclipsed''' conformation has a torsion angle of 120° (or 240°). It is a local energy maximum.

*The '''antiperiplanar''' conformation has a torsion angle of 180°. The two methyl groups are as far from each other as is possible, and this configuration has the lowest energy.

The difference in energy between the fully eclipsed conformation and the antiperiplanar conformation is about 19&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, and is therefore still relatively small at ambient temperature.

The case of higher alkanes is similar: the antiperiplanar conformation is always the most favoured around each carbon&amp;ndash;carbon bond. For this reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models. The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealised forms, as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules: alkane molecules have no fixed structural form, whatever the models may suggest.

The conformations of other organic molecules are based on those of alkanes, and are discussed in the relevant articles.

==Properties==
===Physical properties===
&lt;!-- Translated from [:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:Alkanschmelzundsiedepunkt.png|right|thumb|300px|Melting (blue) and boiling (pink) points of the first 14 ''n''-alkanes in °C. ]]
The molecular structure, particularly the [[surface area]] of the molecule, determines the boiling point of the alkane: the smaller the surface, the lower the boiling point, as the [[van der Waals force]]s between the molecules are weaker. A reduction of the surface area can be achieved by chain-branching or by a circular structure. This means in practice that alkanes with higher number of carbon atoms usually have higher [[boiling point]]s than those with lower numbers of carbon atoms, and that branched-chain alkanes and [[cycloalkane]]s have lower boiling points than their straight-chain homologues. Under [[standard conditions]], from CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; alkanes are gaseous; from C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt; they are liquids; and after C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt; they are solids. The boiling point increases between 20 and 30&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C per CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-group.

The [[melting point]]s of the alkanes also rise with the increase in the number of carbon atoms (with only one exception, [[propane]]). However the melting points rise more slowly than the boiling points, in particular for the higher alkanes. In addition, the melting points of alkanes with an odd number of carbon atoms increase faster than the melting points of alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms (see figure): the cause of this phenomenon is the higher [[packing density]] of the alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms. The melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, depending on the efficiency of molecular packing: this is particularly true for isoalkanes (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of their normal analogues.

Alkanes do not conduct [[electricity]], nor are they substantially [[Polarization|polarized]] by an [[electric field]]. For this reason they do not form [[hydrogen bond]]s and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water. Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule, the coexistance of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order (a reduction in [[entropy]]). As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimised by minimising the contact between alkane and water: alkanes are said to be [[hydrophobic]] in that they repel water.

Their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good, a property which is called [[lipophilicity]]. Different alkanes are, for example, miscible in all proportions among themselves.

The density of the alkanes usually increases with increasing number of carbon atoms, but remains less than that of water. Hence, alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane-water mixture.

===Chemical properties===
&lt;!-- Translated from [:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
Alkanes generally show a relatively low reactivity, because their C&amp;ndash;H and C&amp;ndash;C bonds are relatively stable and cannot be easily broken. Unlike all other organic compounds, they possess no [[functional group]]s.

They react only very poorly with ionic or other polar substances. The [[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] values of all alkanes are above 60, and so they are practically inert to acids and bases. This inertness is the source of the term ''paraffins'' ([[Latin]] ''para'' + ''affinis'', with the meaning here of &quot;lacking affinity&quot;). In [[crude oil]] the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.

However [[redox reaction]]s of alkanes, in particular with [[oxygen]] and the [[halogen]]s, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition; in the case of [[methane]], the lowest possible [[oxidation state]] for carbon (&amp;minus;4) is reached. Reaction with oxygen leads to [[combustion]]; with halogens, [[substitution]].  In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes.

Free radicals, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as [[cracking]] and [[reformation]] where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers.

In highly brached alkanes, the [[bond angle]]s may differ significantly from the optimal value (109.5&amp;deg;) in order to allow the different groups sufficient space. This causes a tension in the molecule, known as [[steric hinderance]], and can substantially increase the reactivity.

===Thermochemistry===
Alkanes are stable molecules relative to their constituent elements, which is manifested as a negative [[Standard enthalpy change of formation|heat of formation]]. For linear alkanes, each [[methylene]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) unit contributes -5 kcal/mol to the overal heat of formation. Branched alkanes are always a little bit more stable than their linear isomers; for example, 2-methylbutane is more stable than ''n''-pentane by 1.8 kcal/mol, and 2,2-methylpropane is more stable than ''n''-pentane by 5 kcal/mol.

See the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation (data table)#Alkanes|alkane heat of formation table]] for detailed data.

===Spectroscopic properties===
Virtually all organic compounds contain carbon&amp;ndash;carbon and carbon&amp;ndash;hydrogen bonds, and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra. Alkanes are notable for having no other groups, and therefore for the ''absence'' of other characreistic spectroscopic features.
====Infrared spectroscopy====
The carbon&amp;ndash;hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while the carbon&amp;ndash;carbon stretching mode absorbes between 800 and 1300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The carbon&amp;ndash;hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group: methyl groups show bands at 1450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1375&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while methylene groups show bands at 1465&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
====NMR spectroscopy====
The proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = 0&amp;ndash;1. The carbon-13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon: &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 8&amp;ndash;30 (methyl), 15&amp;ndash;55 (methylene), 20&amp;ndash;60 (methyne). The carbon-13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak, due to the lack of [[nuclear Overhauser enhancement]] and the long [[relaxation time]]: it can be missed in routine spectra.

====Mass spectrometry====
Alkanes have a high [[ionisation energy]], and the molecular ion is usually weak. The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret, but, in the case of branched chain alkanes, the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting [[free radical]]s. The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group (M&amp;minus;15) is often absent, and other fragment are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units, corresponding to sequential loss of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-groups.

==Reactions==
===Reactions with oxygen===
All alkanes react with [[oxygen]] in a [[combustion]] reaction, although they become increasing difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases. The general equation for complete combustion is:
:2C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt; + (3''n''+1)O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2(''n''+1)H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2''n''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
In the absence of sufficient oxygen, [[carbon monoxide]] or even [[soot]] can be formed, as shown below for [[methane]]:
:2CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2CO + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; C + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Alkanes usually burn with a non-luminous flame with very little soot formation.

The [[standard enthalpy change of combustion]], &amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, for alkanes increases by about 650&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol per CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group. Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of &amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.

===Reactions with halogens===
Alkanes react with [[halogen]]s in a so-called [[halogenation]] reaction. The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced, or [[Substitution|substituted]], by halogen atoms. [[Free radical]]s are the reactive species which participate in the reaction, which usually leads to a mixture of products. The reaction is highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], and can lead to an explosion.

The chain mechanism is as follows, using the chlorination of methane as a typical example:
:'''1.''' ''Initiation'': splitting of a chlorine molecule to form two chlorine atoms, initiated by [[ultraviolet radiation]]. A chlorine atom has an unpaired electron and acts as a free radical.
::Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2Cl&amp;middot;
:'''2.''' ''Propagation'' (two steps): a hydrogen atom is pulled off from methane then the methyl radical pulls a Cl&amp;middot; from Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
::CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&amp;middot; &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot; + HCl
::CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + Cl&amp;middot;
:This results in the desired product plus another chlorine radical. This radical will then go on to take part in another propagation reaction causing a chain reaction. If there is sufficient chlorine, other products such as CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be formed.
:'''3.''' ''Termination'': recombination of two free radicals:
::Cl&amp;middot; + Cl&amp;middot; &amp;rarr; Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; or
::CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot; + Cl&amp;middot; &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl; or
::CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot; + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot; &amp;rarr; C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.
:The last possibility in the termination step will result in an impurity in the final mixture; notably this results in an organic molecule with a longer carbon chain than the reactants.

In the case of methane or ethane, all the hydrogen atoms are equivalent and have an equal chance of being replaced. This leads to what is known as a ''statistical product distribution''. For propane and higher alkanes, the hydrogen atoms which form part of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (or CH) groups are preferentially replaced.

The reactivity of the different halogens varies considerably: the relative rates are: [[fluorine]] (108) &gt; [[chlorine]] (1) &gt; [[bromine]] (7&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;11&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; [[iodine]] (2&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;22&lt;/sup&gt;). Hence the reaction of alkanes with fluorine is difficult to control, that with chlorine is moderate to fast, that with bromine is slow and requires high levels of UV irradiation while the reaction with iodine is practically non-existent and [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] unfavorable.

These reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons.

===Cracking and reforming===
&quot;[[Cracking]]&quot; breaks larger molecules into smaller ones. This can be done with a thermic or catalytic method. The thermal cracking process follows a homolytic mechanism, that is, bonds break symmetrically and thus pairs of [[free radical]]s are formed. The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of [[acid]] [[catalyst|catalysts]] (usually solid acids such as [[silica-alumina]] and [[zeolite|zeolites]]) which promote a heterolytic (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of [[ion|ions]] of opposite charges, usually a carbo[[cation]] and the very unstable [[hydride]] [[anion]]. Carbon-localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C-C scission in position [[beta scission|beta]] (i.e., cracking) and [[intramolecular|intra-]] and [[intermolecular]] hydrogen transfer or [[hydride transfer]]. In both types of processes, the corresponding reactive intermediates (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a
self-propagating chain mechanism. The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.

Here is an example of cracking with butane CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

* 1st possibility (48%): breaking is done on the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bond.

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;* / *CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

after a certain number of steps, we will obtain an alkane and an [[alkene]]:
CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

* 2nd possibility (38%): breaking is done on the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bond.

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* / *CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

after a certain number of steps, we will obtain an alkane and an [[alkene]]
from different types: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

* 3rd possibility (14%): breaking of a C-H bond

after a certain number of steps, we will obtain an [[alkene]] and hydrogen gas: CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Other reactions===
&lt;!-- translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
Alkanes will react with [[steam]] in the presence of a [[nickel]] [[catalyst]] to give [[hydrogen]]. Alkanes can by [[Chlorosulfonation|chlorosulfonated]] and [[nitration|nitrated]], although both reactions require special conditions. The [[fermentation]] of alkanes to [[carboxylic acid]]s is of some technical importance. In the [[Reed reaction]],  [[sulfur dioxide]], [[chlorine]] and [[photochemistry|light]] convert hydrocarbons to [[Sulfonic acid|sulfonyl chloride]]s.

==Hazards==
Methane is explosive in when mixed with air (1&amp;ndash;8% CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and is a strong [[greenhouse gas]]: other lower alkanes can also form explosive mixtures with air. The lighter liquid alkanes are highly flammable, although this risk decreases with the length of the carbon chain. Pentane, hexane, heptane and octane are classed as ''dangerous for the environment'' and ''harmful''. The straight chain isomer of hexane is a [[neurotoxin]], and therefore rarely used commercially.

==Alkanes in nature==
&lt;!-- Translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
Although alkanes occur in nature in various way, they do not rank biologically among the essential materials. Cycloalkanes with 14 to 18 carbon atoms occur in [[musk]], extracted from [[deer]] of the family [[Moschidae]]. All further information refers to acyclic alkanes.

===Bacteria and archaea===
&lt;!-- Translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:Rotbuntes Rind.jpg|thumb|right|[[Methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the [[methane]] in the Earth's atmosphere.]]
Certain types of [[bacteria]] can metabolise alkanes: they prefer even-numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains.

On the other hand certain [[archaea]], the [[methanogen]]s, produce large quantites of [[methane]] by the metabolism of [[carbon dioxide]] or other [[oxidation|oxidised]] organic compounds. The energy is released by the oxidation of [[hydrogen]]:
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Methanogens are also the producers of [[marsh gas]] in [[wetlands]], and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year&amp;mdash;the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them. The methane output of [[cattle]] and other [[herbivore]]s, which can release up to 150&amp;nbsp;litres per day, and of [[termite]]s, is also due to methanogens. They also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the [[intestine]]s of [[human]]s. Methanogenic archaea are hence at the end of the [[carbon cycle]], with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by [[photosynthesis]]. It is probable that our current deposits of [[natural gas]] were formed in a similar way.

===Fungi and plants===
&lt;!-- Translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:Fuji apple.jpg|thumb|right|Water forms droplets on a thin film of alkane wax on the skin of the apple.]]
Alkanes also play a role, if a minor role, in the biology of the three [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] groups of organisms: [[Fungus|fungi]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. Some specialised yeasts, e.g. ''Candida tropicale'', ''[[Pichia]]'' sp., ''[[Rhodotorula]]'' sp., can use alkanes as a source of carbon and/or energy. The fungus ''[[Amorphotheca resinae]]'' prefers the longer-chain alkanes in [[aviation fuel]], and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions.

In plants it is the solid long-chain alkanes that are found; they form a firm layer of wax, the [[cuticle]], over areas of the plant exposed to the air. This protects the plant against water loss, while preventing the [[leaching]] of important minerals by the rain. It is also a protection against bacteria, fungi and harmful [[insect]]s&amp;mdash;the latter sink with their legs into the soft waxlike substance and have difficulty moving. The shining layer on fruits such as apples consists of long-chain alkanes. The carbon chains are usually between twenty and thirty carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants from [[fatty acid]]s. The exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species-dependent, but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions, temperature or humidity.

===Animals===
&lt;!-- Translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
Alkanes are found in animal products, although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons. On example is the shark liver oil, which is approximately 14% [[pristane]] (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane, C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;). Their occurrence is more important in [[pheromone]]s, chemical messenger materials, on which above all insects are dependent for communication. With some kinds, as the support beetle ''[[Xylotrechus colonus]]'', primarily [[pentacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;), 3-methylpentaicosane (C&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;) and 9-methylpentaicosane (C&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;), they are transferred by body contact. With others like the [[tsetse fly]] ''Glossina morsitans morsitans'', the pheromone contians the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane (C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;), 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;), 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;82&lt;/sub&gt;), and
acts by smell over longer distances, a useful characteristic for [[pest control]].

===Ecological relations===
&lt;!-- Translated from [[:de:Alkane]] --&gt;
[[Image:Ophrys sphegodes flower.jpg|thumb|right|Early spider orchid (''Ophrys sphegodes'')]]
One example, in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role, is the ecological relationship between the [[sand bee]] (''[[Andrena nigroaenea]]'') and the [[early spider orchid]] (''[[Ophrys sphegodes]]''); the latter is dependent for [[pollination]] on the former. Sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate; in the case of ''A. nigroaenea'', the females emit a mixture of [[tricosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pentacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[heptacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;56&lt;/sub&gt;) in the ratio 3:3:1, and males are attracted by specifically this odour. The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen; parts of its flower  not only resemble the appearance of sand bees, but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees. As a result numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempte to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavour is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen,
which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the legal term. For other usages see [[Appeal (disambiguation)]].''

An '''appeal''' is the act or fact of challenging a judicially cognizable and binding [[judgment]] to a higher judicial authority. In [[common law]] jurisdictions, most commonly, this means formally filing a [[notice of appeal]] with a lower court, indicating one's intention to take the matter to the next higher court with jurisdiction over the matter, and then actually filing the appeal with the appropriate [[Court of Appeals|appellate court]]. 

==United States==
The [[United States]] legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals: a trial ''de novo'' or an appeal on the record.

A [[trial de novo]] is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by [[administrative agency|administrative agency]], referees, masters, commissioners and some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial [[trial (law)|trial]].  If unchallenged, these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all.  If a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal, one generally has the power to request a trial ''de novo'' by a [[court of record]].  In such a proceeding, all issues and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] may be developed newly, as though never heard before, and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding.  Sometimes, however, the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence, thus helping to curb frivolous appeals.

In an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding, both [[appellant]] and [[respondent]] are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal.  Each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result.  [[Precedent]] and [[case law]] figure prominently in the arguments.  In order for the appeal to succeed, the appellant must prove that the lower court committed [[reversible error]], that is, an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust, and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly.  Some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the [[jury]] on the law applicable to the case, permitting seriously [[improper argument]] by an attorney, admitting or excluding evidence improperly, acting outside the court's jurisdiction, injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so, juror misconduct, etc.  The failure to formally object at the time, to what one views as improper action in the lower court, may result in the affirmance of the lower court's judgment on the grounds that one did not &quot;preserve the issue for appeal&quot; by objecting.

In cases where a [[judge]] rather than a [[jury]] decided issues of fact, an appellate court will apply an ''abuse of discretion'' standard of review. Under this standard, the appellate court gives deference to the lower court's view of the evidence, and reverses its decision only if it was a clear abuse of discretion. This is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness.  On the other hand, the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower court's decision on issues of law, and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard.

In some rare cases, an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was [[unconstitutional]] or otherwise invalid, or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered.  In the case of new evidence, there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial.  Another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel. If a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case ''and'' that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation, he is entitled to a new trial.

An appellate court is a [[court]] that hears cases in which a [[lower court]] -- either a [[trial court]] or a lower-level appellate court &amp;#8212; has already made a decision, but in which at least one party to the action wants to challenge this ruling based upon some legal grounds that are allowed to be appealed either by right or by leave of the appellate court.  These grounds typically include errors of [[law]], [[fact]], or [[due process]].

In different jurisdictions, appellate courts are also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts.

==Who can appeal==
A party who files an appeal is called an ''appellant'', and a party on the other side is an ''appellee'' or ''respondent'' or, in some jurisdictions, the party who files is known as a ''petitioner'' and the party being sued is designated the ''respondent''.  Cross-appeals can also occur, when more than one party to a case is unhappy with the decision in some way, often when the winning party claims that more damages were deserved than were awarded.

An appeal ''as of right'' is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle.  The appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal.  An appeal ''by leave'' or ''permission'' requires the appellant to move for leave to appeal; in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the appellate court have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant's demand to appeal the lower court's decision.

In [[tort]], [[equity]], or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal.  In criminal matters, however, the state or prosecution generally has no appeal ''as of right''.  And due to the [[double jeopardy]] principle, the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict.  But in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal ''as of right'' from a trial court's dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial court's granting of a defendant's suppression motion.  Likewise, in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law ''by leave'' from the trial court and/or the appellate court.

==How an appeal is processed==
Generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] presented in the trial court and the [[law]] that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not.  The appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower court's findings of fact (such as whether a defendant committed a particular act), unless clearly erroneous, and so will focus on the court's application of the law to those facts (such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue).  

If the appellate court finds no defect, it &quot;affirms&quot; the judgment.  If the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision &quot;below&quot; (i.e., in the lower court), it may &quot;modify&quot; the ruling to correct the defect, or it may nullify (&quot;reverse&quot; or &quot;vacate&quot;) the whole decision or any part of it.  It may in addition send the case back (&quot;remand&quot; or &quot;remit&quot;) to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect.  

In some cases an appellate court may review a lower court decision ''de novo'' (or completely), challenging even the lower court's findings of fact.  This might be the proper standard of review, for example, if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pre-trial [[motion to dismiss]] or motion for [[summary judgment]] which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony.  

Another situation is where appeal is by way of ''re-hearing''. Certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court. An example would be an appeal from a [[Magistrate's court]] to the [[Crown Court]] in [[England and Wales]].

Sometimes the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits, which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below.  (This would happen, for example, if the appellant waited too long, under the appellate court's rules, to file the appeal.)  In [[England]] and many other jurisdictions, however, the phrase ''appeal dismissed'' is equivalent to the [[United States|U.S.]] term ''affirmed''; and the phrase ''appeal allowed'' is equivalent to the U.S. term ''reversed''.

Generally there is no [[Jury trial|trial]] in an appellate court, only consideration of the [[record]] of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre-trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed &amp;#8212; unless the appeal is by way of re-hearing, new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in ''very'' rare instances, for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as [[prosecutorial misconduct]].

In some systems an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court, together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal. In other systems, the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court. In those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court.

The appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee (or respondent) can present arguments against it.  Arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate [[lawyer]]s, if represented, or ''[[pro se]]'' if the party has not engaged legal representation.  Those arguments are presented in written [[brief (law)|briefs]] and sometimes in [[oral argument]] to the court at a [[hearing (law)|hearing]]. At such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs.

It is important to note that in an [[adversarial system]] appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it. Therefore if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner or against [[legal precedent]] that judgment will stand even if it might have been overturned on appeal.

In the [[United States]], a [[lawyer]] traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words &quot;May it please the court.&quot;

{{CivilProcedure}}

An '''answer''' (derived from ''and'', against, and the same root as ''swear'') was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to some one or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or defence, a reply to a question or objection, or a correct solution of a problem.  In the [[common law]], an '''answer''' is the first [[pleading]] by a [[defendant]], usually filed and served upon the [[plaintiff]] within a certain strict time limit after a civil [[complaint]] or criminal [[information]] or [[indictment]] has been served upon the defendant.  It may have been preceded by an ''optional'' &quot;pre-answer&quot; [[motion to dismiss]] or [[demurrer]]; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant ''must'' file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse [[default judgment]]. 

The ''answer'' establishes which allegations ([[cause of action]] in civil matters) set forth by the complaining party will be contested by the defendant, and states all the defendant's [[Defense (legal)|defense]]s, thus establishing the nature and parameters of the controversy to be decided by the [[court]].

In the case of a criminal case there is usually an [[arraignment]] or some other kind of appearance before the court by the defendant.  The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is either [[guilt|guilty]] or not guilty. Generally speaking in private, civil cases there is no guilt or innocence. There is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of [[equitable remedy]] such as [[restitution]] or an [[injunction]]. Criminal cases may lead to [[fine]]s or other [[punishment]], such as [[imprisonment]].

The famous Latin ''Responsa Prudentum'' (&quot;answers of the learned&quot;) were the accumulated views of many successive generations of Roman lawyers, a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative.

In music an &quot;'''answer'''&quot; is the technical name in counterpoint for the repetition by one part or instrument of a theme proposed by another.

'''Arraignment''' is a [[common law]] term for the formal reading of a [[crime|criminal]] [[complaint]], in the presence of the [[defendant]], to inform him of the charges against him. In response to arraignment, the accused is expected to enter a [[plea]]. Acceptable pleas vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but they generally include &quot;guilty&quot;, &quot;not guilty&quot;, and the [[peremptory pleas]] (or pleas in bar), which set out reasons why a trial cannot proceed. In addition, [[United States|US]] jurisdictions allow pleas of &quot;[[nolo contendere]]&quot; (no contest) and the &quot;[[Alford plea]]&quot; in some circumstances. 

In the [[UK]] arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the [[clerk]] of the [[court]] reading out the [[indictment]]. The defendant is asked whether they plead guilty or not guilty to each individual charge. 

==Guilty and Not Guilty pleas==
If the defendant pleads guilty an [[preliminary hearing|evidentiary hearing]] usually follows. The court is not required to accept a guilty plea. During that hearing the judge will assess the offense, [[mitigating factor]]s, and the defendant's character; and then pass [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]. If the defendant pleads [[not guilty]], a date will be set for a [[preliminary hearing]] or [[Jury trial|trial]].

==What if the defendant enters no plea?==
In the past, a defendant who refused to plea (or, &quot;stood mute&quot;) would be subjected to [[Crushing|peine forte et dure]] ([[Law French]] for &quot;strong and hard punishment&quot;). But today in all common law jurisdictions, defendants who refuse to enter a plea will have a plea of not guilty entered for them on their behalf.

==The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure==
The US ''[[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]]'' state: &quot;...arraignment shall...[consist of an] open...reading [of] the [[indictment]]...to the defendant...and calling on him to plead thereto. He shall be given a copy of the indictment...before he is called upon to plead.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;'''America the Beautiful'''&quot; is an [[United States|American]] [[patriotic song]] which rivals &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;, the [[national anthem]] of the United States, in popularity.  It is often found in [[Christian]] [[hymn]]als in a wide variety of churches in the United States, and may be sung as part of a Christian service of worship to [[The Trinity|God]].

==History==

The words are by [[Katharine Lee Bates]], an English teacher at [[Wellesley College]]. She had taken a train trip to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]] in [[1893]] to teach a short summer school session at [[Colorado College]], and several of the sights on her trip found their way into her poem:
*The [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], the &quot;White City&quot; with its promise of the future contained within its alabaster buildings.
*The wheat fields of [[Kansas]], through which her train was riding on [[July 4]].
*The majestic view of the [[Great Plains]] from atop [[Pike's Peak]].
On that mountain, the words of the poem started to come to her, and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original Antlers Hotel. The poem was initially published two years later in ''[[The Congregationalist]]'', to commemorate the [[Independence Day (US)|Fourth of July]]. It quickly caught the public's fancy. Amended versions were published in 1904 and 1913.

Several existing pieces of music were adapted to the poem. The [[hymn]] ''Materna'', composed in [[1882]] by [[Samuel A. Ward]], was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Ward had been similarly inspired. The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from [[Coney Island]] back to his home in [[New York City]] after a leisurely summer day, and he immediately wrote it down. Ward died in 1903, not knowing the national stature his music would attain. Miss Bates was more fortunate, as the song's popularity was well-established by her death in 1929.

At various times in the more than 100 years that have elapsed since the song as we know it was born, particularly during the [[John F. Kennedy]] administration, there have been efforts to give &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; legal status either as a national hymn, or as a national anthem equal to, or in place of, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, but so far this has not succeeded. Proponents prefer &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; for various reasons, saying it is easier to sing, more melodic, and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot; Some prefer &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; over &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; due to the latter's war-oriented imagery. (Others prefer &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; for the same reason.) While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem, &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of Americans.

Popularity of the song soared following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]; at some sporting events it was sung in addition to the traditional singing of the national anthem.

[[Ray Charles]] is credited with the song's most well known rendition in current times (although [[Elvis Presley]] had a good success with it in the 70´s). His recording is very commonly played at major sporting events, such as the [[Super Bowl]]. His unique take on it places the third verse first, after which he sings the usual first verse. In the third verse (see below), the author scolds the [[materialistic]] and self-serving [[robber baron]]s of her day, and urges America to live up to its noble ideals and to honor, with both word and deed, the memory of those who died for their country...a message that resonates just as strongly today.&lt;!-- Agreed.  Also see the entire set of 1913 lyrics (source listed below) where this antimaterialist, God-centered theme is repeated in one of the forgotten to most American's ears &quot;extra&quot; lyrics.  --&gt;

An amusing oddity of the song is that its meter (technically &quot;[[Common metre|common meter double]]&quot; or 8-6-8-6-8-6-8-6) is identical to that of ''[[Auld Lang Syne]]''. The two songs can be sung perfectly with lyrics interchanged.

==Lyrics==
Oh beautiful, for spacious skies,&lt;br /&gt;
For amber waves of grain,&lt;br /&gt;
For purple mountain majesties&lt;br /&gt;
Above the fruited plain!&lt;br /&gt;
''America! America!  God shed his grace on thee,''&lt;br /&gt;
''And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea.''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Oh beautiful, for pilgrims' feet&lt;br /&gt;
Whose stern, impassioned stress&lt;br /&gt;
A thoroughfare for freedom beat&lt;br /&gt;
Across the wilderness!&lt;br /&gt;
''America! America!  God mend thine ev'ry flaw;''&lt;br /&gt;
''Confirm thy soul in self control, thy liberty in law!''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Oh beautiful, for heroes proved&lt;br /&gt;
In liberating strife,&lt;br /&gt;
Who more than self their country loved&lt;br /&gt;
And mercy more than life!&lt;br /&gt;
''America! America!  May God thy gold refine,''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Til all success be nobleness, and ev'ry gain divine!''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Oh beautiful, for patriot's dream&lt;br /&gt;
That sees beyond the years!&lt;br /&gt;
Thine alabaster cities gleam&lt;br /&gt;
Undimmed by human tears!&lt;br /&gt;
''America! America!  God shed his grace on thee,''&lt;br /&gt;
''And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea!''

==Takeoffs==
A song as popular and familiar as &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; inevitably gets used out of its proper context or time frame, for humorous effect. As the song seems to have &quot;always been there&quot;, it is often presented as if [[Christopher Columbus]] had written it when he arrived at the [[New World]] (though in fact, Columbus never set foot on [[North America]]; all his voyages were to the [[Caribbean|Caribbean islands]], [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]]). Some examples:

*In 1971, the song inspired the cross-country [[Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash]] race from New York to Los Angeles that later was the topic of several movies with [[Burt Reynolds]]

*A ''[[Far Side]]'' cartoon from 1982 (reprinted in Sherr's book) shows Columbus nearing land, with his crew of ''conquistador'' types, and saying, &quot;Look, gentlemen! Purple mountains! Spacious skies! Fruited plains! ... Is someone writing this down?&quot;

*In one of his comedy club routines in the early [[1960s]], [[Flip Wilson]] did a Columbus story with an African-American twist... ironically, the catchphrase repeated by Queen Isabel (an early &quot;Geraldine&quot;) is &quot;Chris gon' find Ray Charles!&quot;  When his Columbus sees land, he comments, &quot;It's America, all right... just look at those spacious skies... those amber waves of grain... dig that purple mountain's majesty... I'll bet there's fruit out there on the plain!&quot;

*In his satirical, musical [[record album]], ''The United States of America, Volume 1'', [[Stan Freberg]] plays Columbus, [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]] plays a skeptical King Ferdinand, and [[Colleen Collins]] does Queen Isabella (mimicking [[Tallulah Bankhead]]), resulting in this bit of dialogue: [http://freberg.8m.com/text/usa1.html]

:Ferdinand: Look at him in that hat! Is that a crazy sailor? 
:Isabella: Crazy? I'll tell you how crazy! He's a man with a dream, a vision, a vision of a new world, whose alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears, with purple mountain majesties above the [[Two Cents Plain]] . . . 
:Ferdinand and Columbus: Fruited!
:Isabella: Fruited.

[[Mel Brooks]], on a talk show, once did an impression of how [[Frank Sinatra]] might sing the song, complete with tuxedo, black hat and coat, and cigarette, leaning up against a bar, and rendering the song in &quot;lounge style&quot;.

[[George Carlin]] performed a satirical version around 1970, when environmental issues were becoming a hot political topic: [http://www.creativequotations.com/one/1309b.htm]

:Oh beautiful, for smoggy skies, insecticided grain
:For strip-mined mountain's majesty above the asphalt plain.
:America, America, man sheds his waste on thee
:And hides the pines with billboard signs, from sea to oily sea!


[[Wellesley College]] students and alumnae tend to change &quot;brotherhood&quot; to &quot;SISTERhood&quot; in renditions of the song.

==Books==
[[Lynn Sherr]]'s 2001 book ''America the Beautiful'' discusses the origins of the song and the backgrounds of its authors in depth.  ISBN 1-58648-085-5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Assistive Technology''' (AT) is a generic term that includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices and the process used in selecting, locating, and using them.  AT promotes greater independence for [[disability|people with disabilities]] by enabling them to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to or changed methods of interacting with the [[technology]] needed to accomplish such tasks. According to disability advocates,  technology, all too often, is created without regard to people with disabilities, and unnecessary barriers make new technology inaccessible to hundreds of millions.

Universal (or broadened) accessibility, or [[universal design]] means excellent [[usability]], particularly for people with disabilities.  But, argue advocates of assistive technology, universally accessible technology yields great rewards to the typical user; good accessible design ''is'' universal design, they say.  The classic example of an assistive technology that has improved everyone's life is the &quot;[[curb cut]]s&quot; in the sidewalk at street crossings.  While these curb cuts surely enable pedestrians with mobility impairments to cross the street, they have also aided parents with carriages and strollers, shoppers with carts, and travellers and workers with pull-type bags, not to mention [[skateboard]]ers and [[inline skate]]rs.

Consider an example of an assistive technology.  The modern [[telephone]] is, except for the deaf, universally accessible.  Combined with a [[Telecommunications devices for the deaf|text telephone]] (also known as a TDD [Telephone Device for the Deaf] and in the USA generally called a TTY[TeleTYpewriter]), which converts typed characters into tones that may be sent over the telephone line, the deaf person is able to communicate immediately at a distance.  Together with &quot;relay&quot; services (where an operator reads what the deaf person types and types what a hearing person says) the deaf person is then given access to everyone's telephone, not just those of people who possess text telephones.  Many telephones now have volume controls, which are primarily
intended for the benefit of people who are hard of hearing, but can be useful for all
users at times and places where there is significant background noise.

Another example: [[calculator]]s are cheap, but a person with a mobility impairment can have difficulty using them.  [[Speech recognition]] software could recognize short commands and make use of calculators a little easier.  People with cognitive disabilities would appreciate the simplicity; others would as well.

Toys which have been adapted to be used by children with disabilities, may have advantages for &quot;typical&quot; children as well. The [[Lekotek]] movement assists parents by lending assistive technology toys and expertise to families.

Telecare is a particular sort of assistive technology that uses electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer.  A good example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors, thermometers (for [[hypothermia]] risk), flooding and unlit gas sensors (for people with mild [[dementia]]).  The principle being that these alerts can be customised to the particular person's risks.  When the alert is triggered, a message is sent to a carer or contact centre who can respond appropriately.  The range of sensors is wide and expanding rapidly.

Technology similar to Telecare can also be used to act within a person's home rather than just to respond to a detected crisis. Using one of the examples above, unlit gas sensors for people with dementia can be used to trigger a device that turns off the gas and tells someone what has happened. This is safer than just telling an external person that there is a problem.

Designing for people with dementia is a good example of where the design of the interface of a piece of assistive technology (AT) is critical to its usefulness. It is important to make sure that people with dementia or any other identified user group are involved in the design process to make sure that the design is accessible and useable. In the example above, a voice message could be used to remind the person with dementia to turn of the gas himself, but who's voice should be used, and what should the message say? Questions like these must be answered through user consultantion, involvement and evaluation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{about|the calculator|the flat slab at the top of a column|[[abacus (architecture)]]}}
An '''abacus''' is a calculation tool, often constructed as a wooden frame with beads sliding on wires.  It was in use centuries before the adoption of the written [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] and is still widely used by merchants and clerks in [[China]] and elsewhere.

The origins of the abacus are disputed, suggestions including invention in [[Babylonia]] and in [[China]], to have taken place between 2400 BC and 300 BC. The first abacus was almost certainly based on a flat stone covered with sand or dust.  Lines were drawn in the sand and pebbles used to aid calculations. From this, a variety of abaci were developed;  the most popular were based on the bi-quinary system, using a combination of two bases (base-2 and base-5) to represent decimal numbers

The use of the word ''abacus'' dates back to before 1387 when a [[Middle English]] work borrowed the word from [[Latin]] to describe a sandboard abacus. The Latin word came from ''abakos'', the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Genitive case|genitive form]] of ''abax'' (&quot;calculating-table&quot;). Because ''abax'' also had the sense of &quot;table sprinkled with sand or dust, used for drawing geometric figures,&quot; it is speculated by some linguists that the Greek word may be derived from a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Root (philology)|root]], ''ābāq'', the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for &quot;dust.&quot;  Though details of the transmission are obscure, it may also be derived from the [[Phoenician]] word ''abak'', meaning &quot;sand&quot;. The plural of abacus is abaci.

== Babylonian abacus ==
{{Main|Babylonian abacus}}
A tablet found on the island of Salamis (near Greece) in 1846 dates back to the Babylonians of 300 BC making it the oldest counting board discovered so far. It was originally thought to be a gaming board. 

Its construction is a slab of white marble measuring 149cm in length, 75cm in width and 4.5cm thick, on which are 5 groups of markings. In the center of the tablet are a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line, capped with a semi-circle at the intersection of the bottom-most horizontal line and the single vertical line. Below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it. Below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines, again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them but with the semi-circle at the top of the intersection; the third, sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line.

== Roman abacus ==
{{Main|Roman abacus}}
[[image:RomanAbacusRecon.jpg|right|Reconstruction of Roman Abacus]] 
  &lt;!-- This image is a 2004 photograph of the Mainz reconstruction of the 
  original in the Paris Library.  It gives a much clearer picture that the 
  device is not beads on wires than the drawing used in this entry earlier.  
  If we are only allowed one image then this is the better to use.    
  [[User:Mfc|mfc]] --&gt;

The [[Roman Empire|Late Empire]] [[Roman abacus]] shown here in reconstruction contains eight long and eight shorter grooves, the former having up to five beads in each and the latter one.

The groove marked I indicates units, X tens, and so on up to millions.  The beads in the shorter grooves denote fives&amp;mdash;five units, five tens, ''etc.'', essentially in a [[bi-quinary coded decimal]] system, obviously related to the [[Roman numerals]].  The short grooves on the right may have been used for marking Roman ounces.

Computations are made by means of beads which would probably have been slid up and down the grooves to indicate the value of each column.

==Chinese abacus==
{{Main|Chinese abacus}}
The '''suanpan''' ({{zh-stp|s=&amp;#31639;&amp;#30424;|t=&amp;#31639;&amp;#30436;|p=su&amp;agrave;np&amp;aacute;n}}) of the [[China|Chinese]] is similar to the Roman abacus in principle, though has a different construction, and it was designed to do both decimal and hexadecimal arithmetics.

[[image:abacus_6.png|right|Chinese abacus, the suanpan]]
The Chinese abacus is typically around 20 cm (8 inches) tall and it comes in various widths depending on the application.  It usually has more than seven rods.  There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom for both decimal and hexadecimal computation.  The beads are usually rounded and made of a hard wood.  The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam.  The abacus can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick jerk along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center. 

Chinese abaci can be used for functions other than counting.  Unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools, very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cube root]] operations at high speed.

'''Bead arithmetic''' is the calculating technique used with various types of abaci, in particular the Chinese abacus.

== Japanese abacus (Soroban) ==
The Japanese eliminated (first) one bead from the upper deck and (later) another bead from the lower deck in each column of the Chinese abacus. The Japanese also eliminated the use of Qiuchu (Chinese division table).  The method of Chinese division table was still used when there were 5 lower beads.  There came the war of the Multiplication Table versus the Division Table.  The school of Multiplication table prevailed in 1920s.  The rods (number of digits) increase to usually 21, 23, 27 or even 31, thus allowing calculation for more digits.

Soroban is taught in elementary schools as a part of lessons in mathematics. When teaching the soroban, a song-like instruction is given by the tutor. The soroban is about 8 cm (3 inches) tall.  The beads on a soroban are usually shaped as a double cone (bi-cone) to facilitate ease of movement.

Often, primary students may bring along with them two sorobans, one with 1 upper bead and 5 lower beads, the other with 1 upper bead with 4 lower beads, when they learn soroban in school.

The size of beads of soroban is standardized, and they come in two types: the &quot;Japanese&quot; classified soroban for native Japanese, and a separate size for foreigners (since Westerners tend to be larger than most Japanese, and therefore have larger hands and fingers).  The soroban that are for foreigners are made with a plastic pipe on both the left and right side of the frame, while ones made for native Japanese were all made with wooden frames. In this way the &quot;thickness&quot; of the soroban (for foreigners) is higher, rendering it easier for the non-Japanese to manipulate.



&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Soroban.JPG|none|thumb|400px|Japanese soroban]]&lt;/center&gt;

== Russian abacus ==
[[Image:Schoty_abacus.jpg|thumb|Russian abacus]]
The Russian abacus, the [[schoty]] or sjotty (&amp;#1089;&amp;#1095;&amp;#1105;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1099;), usually has a single slanted deck, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire which has four, and acts as a separator or for fractions). This wire is usually near the user. The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires from left to right in the manner of a book. The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center, in order to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides. It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right. During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually have a colour different to the other 8 beads. Likewise, the left bead of the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different color.

The Russian abacus is still in common use today in shops and markets throughout the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|former Soviet Union]], although it is no longer taught in most schools.

== School abacus ==
[[Image:Kugleramme.jpg|right|150px|thumb|School abacus used in Danish elementary school. Early 20th century.]] 

Around the world, abaci have been used in pre-schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching arithmetics. In Western countries, a '''bead frame''' similar to the Russian abacus but with straight wires has been common (see image). It is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy.

== Uses by the visually impaired ==
Abaci are still commonly used by individuals who have [[blindness|visual impairments]].  They use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cubic root]].  A piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they don't move inadvertently.  This keeps the beads in place while the user feels or manipulates them.

Recently, abaci have been replaced to some extent by electronic calculators with speech, but only in those countries where they are easily available and affordable.  However, even when they are available, many visually impaired people still prefer to use the abacus.  In addition, many blind children are required to learn how to use the abacus before they are permitted the use of a talking calculator or similar device.  This can be compared to sighted children being required to learn how to solve mathematical problems on paper before they are allowed the use of a calculator.

== Native American abacus ==
Some sources mention the use of an abacus called a ''Nepohualtzintzin'' in ancient Mayan culture. This Mesoamerican abacus uses the 5-digit base-20 [[Mayan numerals|Mayan numeral]] system.

The [[khipu]] of the [[Inka]]s was a system of knotted cords used to record numerical data - like advanced [[tally stick]]s&amp;mdash;but was not used to perform calculations.

An '''acid''' (often represented by the generic formula '''HA''') is a water-soluble, sour-tasting [[chemical compound]] that when dissolved in [[water]], gives a solution with a [[pH]] of less than 7. 

== Definitions of acids and bases ==

The word &quot;acid&quot; comes from the [[Latin]] ''acidus'' meaning &quot;sour&quot;, but in [[chemistry]] the term acid has a more specific meaning.  There are three common [[Acid-base reaction theories|ways to define an acid]], namely, the '''Arrhenius''', the '''Brønsted-Lowry''' and the '''Lewis''' definitions, in order of increasing generality.

* '''Arrhenius''': According to this definition, an acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ion (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) when dissolved in water, while bases are substances that increase the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).  This definition limits acids and bases to substances that can dissolve in water.  Around 1800, many [[France|French]] chemists, including [[Antoine Lavoisier]], incorrectly believed that all acids contained [[oxygen]]. [[England|English]] chemists, including [[Sir Humphry Davy]] at the same time believed all acids contained hydrogen. The [[Sweden|Swedish]] chemist [[Svante Arrhenius]] used this belief to develop this definition of acid.

* '''Brønsted-Lowry''': According to this definition, an acid is a [[proton]] donor and a base is a proton acceptor. The acid is said to be dissociated after the proton is donated.  An acid and the corresponding base are referred to conjugate acid-base pairs.  [[Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted|Brønsted]] and [[Martin Lowry|Lowry]] formulated this definition, which includes water-insoluble substances not in the Arrhenius definition. 

* '''Lewis''': According to this definition, an acid as an electron-pair acceptor and a base is an electron-pair donor.  (These are frequently referred to as &quot;[[Lewis acid]]s&quot; and &quot;[[Lewis base]]s,&quot; and are [[electrophile]]s and [[nucleophile]]s in [[organic chemistry]]).  Lewis acids include substances with no [[protons]], such as [[iron(III) chloride]].  The Lewis definition can also be explained with [[molecular orbital]] theory. In general, an acid can receive an electron pair in its lowest unoccupied orbital ([[LUMO]]) from the highest occupied orbital ([[HOMO]]) of a base.  That is, the HOMO from the base and the LUMO from the acid combine to a bonding [[molecular orbital]].  This definition was developed by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]].

Although not the most general theory, the Brønsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition.  The strength of an acid may be understood by this defintion by the stability of [[hydronium]] and the solvated conjugate base upon dissociation.  Increasing stability of the the conjugate base will increase the acidity of a compound.  This concept of acidity is used frequently for organic acids such as [[carboxylic acid]].  The molecular orbital description, where the unfilled proton orbital overlaps with a lone pair, is connected to the Lewis definition.

Solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form [[buffer solution]]s.

Acid/base systems are different from [[redox]] reactions in that there is no change in oxidation state.

Generally, acids have the following chemical and physical properties:
* '''Taste''': Acids generally are sour when dissolved in water.
* '''Touch''': Acids produce a stinging feeling, particularly strong acids.
* '''Reactivity''': Acids react aggressively with or corrode  most [[metal]]s. 
* '''Electrical conductivity''': Acids are [[electrolyte]]s.

[[Strong acid]]s are dangerous, causing severe burns for even minor contact. Generally, acid burns are treated by rinsing the affected area abundantly with water and followed up with immediate medical attention.

== Nomenclature ==

Acids are named according to the ending of their [[anion]]. That ionic ending is dropped and replaced with a new suffix according to the table below. For example, HCl has chloride as its anion, so the -ide suffix makes it take the form hydrochloric acid.

== Chemical characteristics ==

In water the following [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] occurs between an acid (HA) and water, which acts as a base:

HA(aq) {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)

The [[acidity constant]] (or acid dissociation constant) is the equilibrium constant for the reaction of HA with water:

:&lt;math&gt;K_a = {[\mbox{H}_3\mbox{O}^+]\cdot[A^-] \over [HA]}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Strong acid]]s have large ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values (i.e. the reaction equilibrium lies far to the right; the acid is almost completely dissociated to H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).  Strong acids include the heavier [[hydrohalic acid]]s: [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), and [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI). (However, [[hydrofluoric acid]], HF, is relatively weak.) For example, the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value for [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) is 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[Weak acid]]s have small ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values (i.e. at equilibrium significant amounts of HA and A&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; exist together in solution; modest levels of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are present; the acid is only partially dissociated). For example, the K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value for acetic acid is 1.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;.  Most organic acids are weak acids.  [[Oxoacid]]s, which tend to contain central atoms in high oxidation states surrounded by oxygen may be quite strong or weak.  [[Nitric acid]], [[sulfuric acid]], and [[perchloric acid]] are all strong acids, whereas [[nitrous acid]], [[sulfurous acid]] and [[hypochlorous acid]] are all weak. 

Note the following:
* The terms &quot;[[hydrogen]] ion&quot; and &quot;proton&quot; are used interchangebly; both refer to H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
* In aqueous solution, the water is protonated to form [[hydronium]] ion, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq).  This is often abbreviated as H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) even though the symbol is not chemically correct.
* The strength of an acid is measured by its [[acid dissociation constant]] (''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) or equivalently its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;= - log(''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;). 
* The [[pH]] of a solution is a measurement of the concentration of [[hydronium]].  This will depend of the concnetration and nature of acids and bases in solution.

=== Polyprotic acids ===

[[Polyprotic]] acids are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule. Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as '''diprotic acid''' (two potenital protons to donate) and '''triprotic acid''' (three potenital protons to donate)  

A monoprotic acid can undergo one [[dissociation]] (sometimes called ionization) as follows and simply has one acid dissociation constant as shown above:

:::::HA(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)  {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;


A diprotic acid (here symbolized by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH.  Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, K&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;.

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)  {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}}  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + HA&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::HA&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)  {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}}  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;

The first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; .  For example, [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) can donate one proton to form the [[bisulfate]] anion (HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;), for which ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the [[sulfate]] anion (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;), wherein the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; is intermediate strength.  The large ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid.  In a similar manner, the weak unstable [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can lose one proton to form [[bicarbonate]] anion (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;) and lose a second to form [[carbonate]] anion (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;).  Both ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values are small, but ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; .


A triprotic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a3&lt;/sub&gt; .

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)  {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}}  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)  {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}}  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + HA&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;

:::::HA&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)  {{unicode|&amp;#8652;}}  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + A&lt;sup&gt;3&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a3&lt;/sub&gt;

An [[inorganic]] example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), usually just called [[phosphoric acid]].  All three protons can be successively lost to yield H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, then HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, and finally PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; , the orthophosphate ion, usually just called [[phosphate]].  An [[Organic compound|organic]] example of a triprotic acid is [[citric acid]], which can successively lose three protons to finally form the [[citrate]] ion.  Even though the positions of the protons on the original molecule may be equivalent, the successive ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values will differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged.

== Neutralization ==

[[Neutralization]] is the reaction between equal amounts of an acid and a base, producing a [[salt]] and [[water (molecule)|water]]; for example, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water:

::HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) -&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) + NaCl(aq)

Neutralization is the basis of [[titration]], where a [[PH indicator|pH indicator]] shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''The term '''asphalt''' is often used as an abbreviation for [[asphalt concrete]].''

'''Asphalt''' is a sticky, black and highly [[viscosity|viscous]] liquid or semi-solid that is present in most crude [[petroleum]]s and in some natural deposits.  Asphalt is composed almost entirely of [[bitumen]]. There is some disagreement amongst [[chemist]]s regarding the structure of asphalt, however it is most commonly modeled as a [[colloid]], with ''asphaltenes'' as the dispersed phase and ''maltenes'' as the continuous phase.

Asphalt is sometimes confused with [[tar]], which is an artificial material produced by the [[destructive distillation]] of [[organic matter]].  Tar is also predominantly composed of bitumen, however the bitumen content of tar is typically lower than that of asphalt.  Tar and asphalt have very different engineering properties.

Asphalt can be separated from the other components in crude oil (such as [[naphtha]], [[gasoline]] and [[diesel]]) by the process of [[fractional distillation]], usually under [[vacuum]] conditions. A better separation can be achieved by further processing of the heavier fractions of the crude oil in a [[de-asphalting unit]] which uses either [[propane]] or [[butane]] in a [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] phase to dissolve the lighter molecules which are then separated. Further processing is possible by &quot;blowing&quot; the product: namely reacting it with [[oxygen]]. This makes the product harder and more viscous.

Natural deposits of asphalt include Lake Asphalts (primarily from the [[Pitch Lake]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Bermudez Lake]] in [[Venezuela]]), [[Gilsonite]], the [[Dead Sea]] in [[Israel]], and [[Tar Sands]].  

Asphalt is rather hard to transport in bulk (it hardens unless kept very hot) so it is sometimes mixed with [[diesel oil]] or [[kerosene]] before shipping. Upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called '''bitumen feedstock''', or BFS.

The largest use of asphalt is for making [[asphalt concrete]] for [[Pavement (material)|pavement]]s, which accounts for approximately 80% of the asphalt consumed in the [[United States]].  [[Roof]]ing [[shingle]]s account for most of the remaining asphalt consumption. Other uses include [[cattle spray]]s, fence post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics.

In the ancient [[middle-east]] natural asphalt deposits were used for [[mortar (masonry)| mortar]] between bricks and stones, ship [[caulking | caulk]], and waterproofing. The [[Persian language | Persian]] word for asphalt is ''mumiya'', which may be the source for the English word [[mummy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''American National Standards Institute''' (ANSI) is a nonprofit organization that oversees the development of standards for products, services, processes and systems in the United States. The organization also coordinates U.S. standards with international standards so that American products can be used worldwide.  For example, standards make sure that people who own cameras can find the film they need for them anywhere around the globe. 

The American National Standards Institute approves standards that are developed by representatives of standards developing organizations, government agencies, consumer groups, companies, and others. These standards make sure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent, that people use the same definitions and terms, and that products are tested the same way.

ANSI accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards. The ANSI accreditation programs conform to international guidelines as verified by government and peer review assessments.

In 1918, five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the American Engineering Standards Committee (AESC). The AESC became the American Standards Association (ASA) in 1928. In 1966, the ASA was reorganized and became the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI). The present name was adopted in 1969. The organization's headquarters are in Washington, D.C. For more information see its Web site at http://www.ansi.org. 

The '''ASA''' photographic exposure system became the basis for the ISO [[film speed]] system, currently used worldwide.

In [[Microsoft Windows]], the phrase &quot;ANSI&quot; refers to the [[Windows ANSI code page]]s. Most of these are fixed width though there are some variable width ones for [[ideographic language]]s. Some of these are very close to the [[ISO-8859]] series leading many to falsely assume that they are identical.

[[ASCII art]] which is colorized or animated by way of ANSI terminal control codes (X3.64 sequences) are commonly referred to as &quot;[[ANSI art]]&quot; and were predominantly popular on [[bulletin board system]]s throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

'''Anchorage''' is a Unified [[Home Rule]] [[Municipality]] (officially called the '''Municipality of Anchorage''') in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]]. It is also a [[census area]]. With 260,283 residents according to the [[U.S. Census, 2000|2000 census]], Anchorage is the largest city in the state of [[Alaska]], composing more than two-fifths of the state's population. A State of Alaska Demographer in 2004 estimates the population at 277,498. Anchorage was founded in 1915 and named after a place where a ship lies at [[anchor]].  Its official [[List of city nicknames|nickname]] is &quot;The City of Lights and Flowers&quot;. Garden writers call Anchorage the &quot;Hanging Basket Capital of the World&quot; when it comes to the city's 100,000 hanging baskets, and aviation buffs refer to the city as the &quot;Air Crossroads of the World&quot; because of its geographical location between the two northern continents. 

In downtown Anchorage along the streets and sidewalks are 425 baskets of bright gold triploid marigold drenched with trailing sapphire lobelia. The blue and gold flowers represent the colors of the Municipality of Anchorage flag and the [[Flag of Alaska|Alaska state flag]]. The city of Anchorage blooms with vibrant color during the late spring and summer when it comes to [[flowers]].   

Today Anchorage has many features of a modern [[urban area]], such as [[park]]s and forests, bike and city trails, [[skiing]] and cross-country ski trails, business and [[commerce]], theaters and other [[entertainment]]s. The [[tourist industry]] is strong and offers many activities and attractions.

== History ==
{{main|History of Anchorage, Alaska}}

Russia was well-established in North America by the 1800s. In 1867, U.S. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] brokered a [[Alaska purchase|deal to purchase Alaska]] from debt-ridden [[Russia]] for $7.2 million, about two cents an acre. Alaska's value was not appreciated by the American masses at that time, calling it &quot;'''Seward's folly'''&quot;, &quot;'''Seward's icebox'''&quot; and &quot;'''Walrussia'''&quot;. By 1888, gold was discovered along [[Turnagain Arm]]. In 1912, Alaska became a [[United States Territory]]. Anchorage was carefully laid out by city planners in 1914, originally as a [[railroad]] [[construction]] [[port]] for the [[Alaska Railroad]], and on [[July 9]], [[1915]], the first sale of town lots was held. In 1915 President [[Woodrow Wilson]] authorized funds for the construction of the [[Alaska Railroad]]. That same year the Anchorage [[Chamber of Commerce]] was formed. Ship Creek Landing in Anchorage was selected as the headquarters of this effort. Soon a &quot;Tent City&quot; sprang up at the mouth of Ship Creek and the population quickly swelled to more than 2,000. Would-be entrepreneurs flocked to this bustling frontier town, and they brought with them everything necessary to build a city. A popular hardware and clothing store, &quot;The Anchorage,&quot; was actually an old dry-docked steamship named &quot;Berth.&quot; Although the area had been known by various names, the [[U.S. Post Office]] Department formalized the use of the name &quot;Anchorage,&quot; and despite some protests the name stuck. In 1920, the United States government relinquished its direct control over the city, and elections were held. Anchorage was incorporated on [[November 23]], [[1920]]. In 1923, [[William Mulcahy]] establishes the Anchorage Baseball League. Mulcahy was a baseball fan who was working as the Alaska Railroad station auditor assistant and established the baseball league in his spare time. Later in life, Mulcahy introduced Little League baseball and established the city's [[YMCA]]. The Mulcahy Park stadium and ball field were named in his honor for his contributions to early Anchorage. 

The 1930s were a time that Anchorage rebounded from the loss of population and industry it had suffered during [[World War I]]. [[Air transportation]] became increasingly important to Anchorage.  
In 1930, the original &quot;Park Strip&quot; landing field was replaced by a new facility, [[Merrill Field]], which had a beacon and a control [[tower]], and in a few short years, it became one of the busiest centers of [[civilian]] [[aircraft]] activity in the [[United States]]. In 1937, [[Providence Alaska Medical Center]] opened its doors.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Anchorage-1940s2.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Fourth Avenue in the 1940s.]] --&gt;
The arrival of US Army troops in 1940 marked a decade of growth based on military expansion for Anchorage. Growth spurted in the 1940s, with the construction of [[Elmendorf Air Force Base]] and [[Fort Richardson]], which made Anchorage a major defense center. In 1940, a canal was built connecting [[Lake Spenard]] with [[Lake Hood]], making it the world's largest [[seaplane]] base. The outbreak of [[World War II]] with the threat of a Japanese invasion prompted continued expansion of military personnel and aircraft, and later the pressures of the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] ensured continued heavy military investment in the Anchorage area. In 1947, the [[parking meter]] was introduced in Anchorage, and in 1949, the first [[traffic light]]s were installed on Fourth Avenue. Between 1939 and 1950, Anchorage's population spurted from 4,230 to 30,060, and the cost of living soared. Anchorage also experienced an unfortunate rise in crime during this tumultuous growth period, a problem the city would fight for decades.

The decade of the 1950s was also eventful. In 1951 came the opening of the [[Seward Highway]]. On [[December 10]], [[1951]], Anchorage established itself as the &quot;Air Crossroads of the World&quot; when Anchorage International Airport opened with transpolar airline traffic flying between Western [[Europe]] and East [[Asia]]. The new airport also became a refueling stop for flights between the contiguous 48 states and East Asia, until nonstop flights became practical around 1970, with the Boeing 747 airliner. In 1953, [[health care]] expanded with the opening of the [[Alaska Native Medical Center]]. Also, three volcanoes erupted in the area, including [[Mount Spurr]], which dumped several inches of ash on Anchorage. [[KTVA]], the city's first [[television station]], began broadcasting in 1953. In 1954, the [[Alyeska Resort]] was established. In 1957, oil was discovered on the [[Kenai Peninsula]]. On [[January 3]], [[1959]], Alaska joined the union as the 49th state. 

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Anc65.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Downtown Anchorage in 1965.]] --&gt;
The decade of the 1960s began on a bright note for Anchorage after Alaska's attaining statehood. After Alaska became a state, Anchorage faced a severe housing shortage, which was solved partially by [[suburb|suburban expansion]]. In January 1964, Anchorage became both a City and a Borough. But on [[March 27]], [[1964]], Anchorage was hit by the [[Good Friday Earthquake]], which registered 9.2 on the [[Richter scale]] and caused tremendous destruction in south Alaska. This earthquake was the strongest ever recorded in [[North America]] and [[United States]] history, and Anchorage lay only 75 miles (120 km) from the [[epicenter]]. It killed 131 people across [[South Central Alaska]], and property damage was estimated at over $300 million (1964 dollars). The brand new J.C. Penney department store in Anchorage was flattened. Anchorage's remarkable recovery from this disaster dominated life in the late 1960s. The continued threat of earthquakes has prompted a limit on the height of buildings in the city; the tallest buildings are 21 stories high. In 1968, Kincaid Park was created in South Anchorage from a former [[Project Nike|Nike]] surface-to-air missile site. That same year, oil was discovered in [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska|Prudhoe Bay]] on the Arctic Slope and, in 1969, oil-lease sales brought billions of dollars to the state.

[[Image:Statue_of_Balto_in_Anchorage.jpg|thumb|right|Statue in downtown Anchorage of [[Balto|Balto]], the lead sled dog during the last part of the [[Iditarod]] serum run.]]
The decade of the 1970s was an important time of growth for the Anchorage economy.  On [[March 3]], [[1973]], the first 1049-mile-long (1690 km) [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]] started from downtown Anchorage with 34 mushers. Twenty-two mushers finished the race, with the last one arriving in [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] one-month after he left the starting line. In recent years, winners have finished the race in less than 10 days. In 1974, construction begain on the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]], with [[Valdez]], not Anchorage, as its southern terminus. The oil discovery and pipline construction fueled a modern-day boom when oil and construction companies set up their headquarters in Anchorage. The pipeline was completed in 1977 at a cost of more than $8 billion. In 1975, Bicentennial Park was created in Southeast Anchorage. On [[September 15]], [[1975]], the city and borough consolidated forming a [[unified government]]. Also included in this unification were [[Eagle River, Alaska|Eagle River]], [[Eklutna, Alaska|Eklutna]], [[Girdwood, Alaska|Girdwood]], [[Glen Alps, Alaska|Glen Alps]], and several other communities. The unified area became officially known as the [[Anchorage Municipality|Municipality of Anchorage]]. By 1980, the population of Anchorage had grown to 174,431. 

The decade of the 1980s was a time of growth, thanks to a flood of North Slope oil revenue into the state treasury. Capital projects and an aggressive beautification program, combined with far-sighted community planning, greatly increased infrastructure and quality of life. These included a new [[library]], [[civic center]], [[arena|sports arena]], and [[performing arts center]]. The 1980s was also a time when Alaska's up-and-down economy struck. The price of oil dropped dramatically, and recession hit Anchorage. But in 1984, [[Hilltop Ski Area]] was established, which along with the [[Alyeska Resort]] in [[Girdwood, Alaska|Girdwood]], and [[Alpenglow at Arctic Valley]] gave residents three fully- operational skiing areas, benefitting tourism and recreational activities. In 1986, Kincaid Outdoor Center opens. In 1989, [[Mount Redoubt]] erupted again, curtailing aviation in the Anchorage area for a short period of time. 

The decade of the 1990s was a time when Anchorage saw gold. In 1996, the Arctic Winter Games were held in [[Chugiak]]/[[Eagle River, Alaska|Eagle River]] and, in 1999, the [[Alaska Native Heritage Center]] opened.

On [[July 8]], [[2000]], the municipal airport was renamed &quot;[[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]]&quot; in honor of Alaska's longest-serving [[United States Senator]].

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:AnchoragewithMcKinleyinthebackground.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A view of downtown Anchorage with a clear view of [[Mount McKinley]] ([[Denali]]) in background.]] --&gt;
In spite of the height limitations on buildings, Anchorage today has an attractive skyline nevertheless, particularly with the [[Chugach Mountains]], [[Cook Inlet]], or the often-visible [[Mount McKinley]] (also known as [[Denali]]) as a backdrop. From Government Hill, one can see the best view of Mount McKinley. Though space is limited in the &quot;Anchorage bowl,&quot; as locals call the peninsula on which the city is located, many parks, greenbelts, and other undeveloped areas can be found within the city itself, making it particularly attractive to nature lovers (to say nothing of the attractions available just a short distance outside the city). Over the past thirty years, however, many of these undeveloped areas have filled in with houses, strip malls, and other development. Nonetheless, there is an enormous amount of land under the Anchorage Municipal control, which totals some 1,955 square miles (5063 km&amp;sup2) - about the size of Delaware. The majority of this land is located within the [[Chugach Mountains]] to the east of the city, which also comprises [[Chugach State Park]].

== Geography and climate ==
=== Geography ===
[[Image:Vicinity map of Municipality of Anchorage.gif|right|350px]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the municipality has a total area of 5,079.2 [[Square Kilometre|km&amp;sup2;]] (1,961.1 [[Square Mile|mi&amp;sup2;]]), 4,395.8 km&amp;sup2; (1,697.2 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is land and 683.4 km&amp;sup2; (263.9 mi&amp;sup2;) of it is water. The total area is 13.46% water.

Anchorage is located in [[South Central Alaska]], at 61 °13'06&quot;North [[latitude]] (about the same as [[Stockholm]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]), -149 °53'57&quot;West [[longitude]] (about the same as [[Hawaii]]), northeast of the [[Alaska Peninsula]], [[Kodiak Island]], and [[Cook Inlet]], due north of the [[Kenai Peninsula]], northwest of [[Prince William Sound]] and [[Alaska Panhandle]], and nearly due south of [[Mount McKinley]]/[[Denali]].  The city is situated on a triangular [[peninsula]] bordered on the east by the rugged, scenic, and eminently hike-worthy [[Chugach Mountains]], on the northwest by the [[Knik Arm]], and on the southwest by the [[Turnagain Arm]], upper branches of the Cook Inlet, which itself is the northernmost reach of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Despite this, the city lacks coastal beaches, instead having wide, treacherous [[mudflats]]. Adjacent to the north is [[Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska]].  To the south is [[Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska]], and to the east is [[Valdez-Cordova Census Area, Alaska]].

=== Climate ===
Average daytime summer temperatures are approximately 55 to 80 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (13 to 27 degrees [[Celsius]]); average daytime winter temperatures are about 5 to 20 degrees (-15 to -7 degrees Celsius) (warmer than many places in the [[The Lower 48|contiguous United States]]). Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (PANC) average January low and high temperatures are 9 °F / 22 °F (-13 °C / -5 °C) with an average winter snowfall of 70.60 inches (179.3 cm). The weather on any given day and indeed for entire seasons can be very unpredictable.  Some winters feature several feet of snow and bitterly cold temperatures, while others, just a foot or two of snow and frequent thaws, which puts dangerous ice on the streets. On [[March 17]], [[2002]], a record 24-hour ([[St. Patrick's Day]]) [[snow]] storm dumped 25.7 inches (65.3 cm) of snow on the Anchorage area, causing the airport and schools to close on that day, and several days longer for the schools. The 1954-1955 winter had 132.8 inches (337.3 cm), which made it the snowiest winter on record. The coldest [[temperature]] ever recorded at [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]] was -38 °F (-38.8 °C) on [[February 3]], [[1948]].  Summers are typically very mild and pleasant, though it can rain frequently.  There isn't any beach-bathing in Anchorage, except at a few local lakes on the warmest summer days, when those lakeside beaches can be extremely popular. Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport average July low and high temperatures are 52 °F / 66 °F (11 °C / 19 °C) and the hottest reading ever recorded was 86 °F (30 °C) on [[June 25]], [[1953]]. The average annual precipitation at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport is 16.07 inches (40.8 cm). Aside from the winter cold, which most Alaskans don't mind, there are two primary nuisances associated with the seasons: in the summer, mosquitoes (which are much worse out in [[Alaskan Bush|the Bush]] than in the city itself); in the winter, long nights and very short days.  Since Anchorage is at such a high latitude, for months in mid-winter, residents go to work in the dark and return home in the dark.  Those who don't study or work next to a window can go all week long without seeing the sun.

Anchoragites exemplify many of the qualities to be found among Alaskans generally: independence, friendliness, practical-mindedness, and a love of the outdoors.  There is, even among businesspeople in Anchorage, a tendency to &quot;dress down&quot;. (There is no [[dress code]] in any Anchorage restaurant.)  This, and a sort of frontier spirit that still lives on in [[Alaska]] generally, gives Anchorage a relatively casual, relaxed atmosphere compared to some other American cities.  (These cultural characteristics are only more exaggerated the farther one moves out of the city into the rest of [[Alaska]].) The city has traditionally served as a destination for immigrants, and there are active [[Asian]], [[Eastern European]], and [[Hispanic]] populations, along with communities of [[African Americans]] and various groups of [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] Alaskans. Over 95 languages are spoken by students in the Anchorage School District.

Both military bases together station over 9,000 military personnels. 

Numerous visitor and [[tourist]] facilities and services are available throughout the Municipality of Anchorage. Nearly all [[Alaska Interior]]-bound tourists pass through Anchorage at some stage of their journeys in Alaska. This is particulatly true since the [[Alaska Railroad]] has its southern terminus in Anchorage. Not surprisingly, the summer is [[tourist|tourist season]], and downtown Anchorage, as well as the highways and railroads leading north and south of the city, are typically teeming with tourists. Anchorage has seasonal factors contribute to a fluctuating, though low, unemployment rate.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Anc-downtown-night-1072.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Downtown Anchorage at night.]] --&gt;
Anchorage is usually the starting or ending point of most visitors' Alaska vacations, and it serves as the airline hub for the state, being serviced by [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]]. Anchorage is served by some national airlines, primarily Seattle-based [[Alaska Airlines]], as well as a number of international airlines. The [[Alaska Railroad]] offers daily summer service to [[Seward]], [[Talkeetna]], [[Denali National Park]], and [[Fairbanks]]. These communities are also served by inter-city bus line from Anchorage. Transportation to downtown Anchorage is convenient by taxicab, airport shuttle, or hotel courtesy shuttles. Upon arrival, visitors can stop by the Anchorage Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau Visitor Information Center or the Alaska Visitors Center for direction. Diamond Airport Parking offers long-term parking with free 24-hour shuttle service to the airport. [[Cruise]] passengers with a few hours or a full day to explore Anchorage can store their luggage (and fish) at the airport. The Ship Creek Shuttle connects key downtown Anchorage locations with the Ship Creek area, including stops at the Alaska Railroad Depot.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Tourist_returning_to_Anchorage_from_Denali_National_Park.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Alaska Railroad tourist returning to Anchorage from [[Denali National Park]].]]  --&gt;
Anchorage also has a [[public transit|bus system]] called People Mover [http://www.muni.org/transit], with a central hub in downtown Anchorage and satellite hubs at [[Dimond Center]] and [[Muldoon Mall]].  People Mover also provides point-to-point van services to seniors and those with disabilities, as well as car pool organization services.

There is only one officially designated [[Interstate Highway]] in Alaska. Unlike the Interstate routes in [[Hawaii]], it is unsigned as such. The route, officially [[Interstate A-1]] runs along the Seward and Glenn Highways. The highway is numbered [[Alaska State Highway 1]]. About 10 miles of the [[Seward Highway]],  (known as the New Seward Highway) is built to [[freeway]] standards. The [[Glenn Highway]], also built to freeway standards goes northeast from Anchorage, six lanes carrying commuter traffic to and from Eagle River, Chugiak, and the Matanuska Valley towns of [[Palmer]] and [[Wasilla]]. The highway is four lanes wide from Eagle River to the junction with the Parks Highway ([[Alaska State Highway 3]]) near Wasilla. Anchorage's roads and the state's highways are all asphalt. They are plowed when necessary in the winter. Highway construction and maintenance is limited to the warm months, so expect some delays.

As of 2005, Anchorage has a long-range transportation plan. Building the Highway to Highway Connection as a limited-access highway link between the Glenn and Seward highways could be the backbone that efficiently delivers traffic to many destinations throughout the city.

Today, traffic is heavy all day long 5th-6th Avenues, Ingra and Gambell, and spills into East Anchorage neighborhoods to avoid congestion. In the Fairview, Mountain View, and Midtown neighborhoods, the new road link would be dug down, out of sight and covered in some areas to allow easy pedestrian and vehicle access across.

=== Medical centers and hospitals ===
[[Providence Alaska Medical Center]] on Providence Drive in Anchorage is the largest hospital in Alaska and is part of [[Providence Health System]] in [[Alaska]], [[Washington]], [[Oregon]] and [[California]]. It features the state's most comprehensive range of services. Providence Health System has a history of serving Alaska, beginning when the Sisters of Providence first brought health care to [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] in 1902. As the territory grew during the following decades, so did efforts to provide care. Their hospitals were opened in [[Fairbanks]] in 1910 and Anchorage in 1937. 

[[Alaska Regional Hospital]] on DeBarr Road in Anchorage was born in 1963 as Anchorage Presbyterian Hospital, located at 8th and L Street downtown. This predecessor to Alaska Regional was a joint venture between local [[physicians]] and the Presbyterian Church. In 1976 the hospital moved to it's present location on DeBarr Road, and is now a 254-bed licensed and accredited facility. Alaska Regional has expanded services and in 1994, Alaska Regional joined with [[HCA]], one of the nation's largest [[healthcare]] providers. 

[[Alaska Native Medical Center]] on Tudor Road, provides medical care and therapeutic health care to Native Alaskans - 229 tribes of [[Eskimos]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] - at the Anchorage site and at 15 satellite facilities throughout the state. ANMC specialists also travel to clinics in the bush to provide care. The 150-bed hospital is also a teaching center for the [[University of Washington]]'s regional medical education program. ANMC houses an office of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and Southcentral Foundation jointly own and manage ANMC.

=== Utilities ===
A full complement of [[utilities]] is available within the Anchorage area. Two [[electric]] companies provide service, depending on where you live within the Municipality of Anchorage. They are: Municipal Light &amp; Power (ML&amp;P) and Chugach Electric Association. 

A municipally-owned utility since 1932, ML&amp;P supplies high-quality and reliable electric power to more than 30,000 residential and commercial customers in the Anchorage area. Chugach Electric Association is a not-for-profit, member-owned cooperative that was formed in 1948. 

Most homes have [[natural gas]]-fueled heat. ENSTAR Natural Gas Company is the sole provider for Anchorage, serving some 90-percent of the city's population. While some homes in Anchorage use private [[wells]] and [[septic]] systems, the Municipality of Anchorage owns and operates the Water and Wastewater Utility serving an approximate population base of 214,000.

== Shopping and entertainment ==
Anchorage has restaurants and places to shop. Anchorage 5th Avenue Mall, located in the heart of downtown Anchorage, has 110 stores including [[Nordstrom]], [[JCPenny]], and the [[Gap]]. 

There is a full-size family-owned [[shopping mall]] in Anchorage: [[Dimond Center]] [http://www.dimondcenter.com] located at the intersection of East Dimond Boulevard and Old Seward Highway is the largest shopping center in Alaska, at 728,000 square feet, with 120,000 square feet of professional office space. The mall is home to over 200 stores and offices and 17 eating establishments, with an [[ice skating rink]], [[bowling alley]], [[athletic|athletic club]], [[library]], and [[cinemas|Dimond 9 Cinemas]]. The anchor stores are: [[Best Buy]], [[Gottschalks]], and [[Old Navy]]. Lodging is offered by the 109-room [[Dimond Center Hotel]] [http://www.dimondcenterhotel.com/]. 

The Mall at [[Sears]] located on East Northern Lights Boulevard has great shopping and food court in the center of town. The Northway Mall is located on Penland Parkway near Airport Heights and the Glenn Highway. Ship Creek Center is a place that has Alaska, Russian gifts, dining, groceries and dancing.

== Points of interest ==
There are features of Anchorage that make it unique: the large tidal range; multiple, beautiful cross-country ski trails; America's highest percentage of licensed airplane pilots (with several airports and landing strips in the city or nearby); a very low [[population density]] for a city its size; frequent small earthquakes; spring windstorms (&quot;[[Chinook wind]]s&quot;); active volcanoes nearby (to the southwest, in the [[Alaska Range]], volcanoes such as [[Mount Spurr]], [[Augustine Volcano]], [[Mount Redoubt (Alaska)|Mount Redoubt]], and others have coated the city with ash in recent years); its extreme youth (it was founded in 1915 but didn't grow much until the 1940s); and much else.  Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Anchorage is definitely an ''American'' city, replete with a vibrant business climate, large [[shopping mall]]s, traffic congestion (one can't easily move about by foot and [[public transportation]] in the middle of winter), suburban-style subdivisions and two [[suburbs]], [[Suburb of Eagle River|Eagle River]] and [[Chugiak]], unless one counts the massive numbers of commuters who drive from as far away as the [[Matanuska Valley]] [http://www.alaskavisit.com/] communities of [[Wasilla, Alaska|Wasilla]] and [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]].

Anchorage has been named an [[All-America City Award|All America City]] in the years 1956, 1965, 1984-85 and most recently in 2002. The city won its latest award based on civic activities like the 2001 [[Special Olympics Winter Games]] [http://www.specialolympicsalaska.org/] , the [[Anchorage Youth Court]] [http://www.ayc.ak.org/], and [[Bridge Builders]] [http://www.bridgebuilders.ak.org/].

'''''Apollo 11''''' was an [[United States|American]] space mission, part of the [[Project Apollo|Apollo program]] and the first manned mission to land on the [[Moon]]. It launched on [[July 16]], [[1969]]. On [[July 20]], mission commander [[Neil Armstrong]] and pilot [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin]] became the first humans to set foot on the Moon.

==Mission highlights==
===Launch and lunar landing===
The ''Apollo 11'' mission launched from the 
[[Kennedy Space Center]] on [[July 16]], [[1969]] at 13:32 UTC (9:32 A.M. local time) and entered Earth orbit 12 minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon. About 30 minutes later, the command/service module pair separated from the last remaining Saturn V stage, turned around, and docked its nose to the top of the lunar module still nestled in the [[Apollo spacecraft#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter .28SLA.29|Lunar Module Adaptor]] 

''Apollo 11'' passed behind the Moon on [[July 19]] and soon after fired its main rocket, entering into lunar orbit. In the several orbits that followed, the crew got passing views of their landing site.

The first ''Apollo'' landing site, in the southern [[Mare Tranquilitatis|Sea of Tranquility]] about 20 km (12 mi) southwest of the crater Sabine D, was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated ''[[Ranger 8]]'' and ''[[Surveyor 5]]'' landers, as well as by ''[[Lunar Orbiter]]'' mapping spacecraft, and therefore unlikely to present major landing or [[Extra-vehicular activity|Extra-vehicular activity (EVA)]] challenges. Armstrong bestowed the name [[Tranquillity Base]] on the landing site immediately after touchdown.

[[Image:Apollo 11 bootprint.jpg|thumb|233px|left|Buzz Aldrin bootprint. It was part of an experiment to test the properties of the lunar [[regolith]].]]

On [[July 20]], [[1969]], while on the [[Far side (Moon)|far side]] of the Moon, the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]], called ''Eagle'', separated from the Command Module, named ''Columbia''.  Collins, now alone aboard ''Columbia'', carefully inspected ''Eagle'' as it pirouetted before him.  Soon after, Armstrong and Aldrin fired ''Eagle'''s engine and began their descent.  They soon saw that they were &quot;running long&quot;; ''Eagle'' was 4 seconds further along its descent trajectory than planned, and would land miles west of the intended site.  The [[Apollo Guidance Computer|LM navigation and guidance computer]] reported several unusual &quot;program alarms&quot; as it guided the LM's descent.  These alarms tore the crew's attention away from the scene outside as the descent proceeded.  In NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, a young [[Flight controller| controller]] named Steve Bales told the [[Flight controller| flight director]] that it was safe to continue the descent in spite of the alarms.  Once they returned their attention to the view outside, the astronauts saw that their computer was guiding them toward a landing site full of large rocks scattered around a large crater. Armstrong took manual control of the lunar module at that point, and guided it to a landing at 20:17 UTC on [[July 20]] with about 30 seconds' worth of fuel left[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html]. 

[[Image:ap11-KSC-69PC-442.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Saturn V]] carrying ''Apollo 11'' took several seconds to clear the tower on [[July 16]], [[1969]].]]

The program alarms were &quot;executive overflows&quot;, indicating that the computer could not finish its work in the time allotted.  The cause was later determined to be the LM rendezvous radar being left on during the descent, causing the computer to spend unplanned time servicing the unused radar.  Steve Bales received a [[Medal of Freedom]] for his &quot;go&quot; call under pressure. Although Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, they also encountered a premature low fuel warning. It was later found caused by the lunar gravity permitting greater propellant 'slosh', uncovering a fuel sensor; extra baffles in the tanks were subsequently added.

At 2:56 UTC on [[July 21]], six and a half hours after landing, Armstrong made his descent to the Moon surface and took his famous &quot;one giant leap for mankind.&quot;  Aldrin joined him, and the two spent two-and-a-half hours drilling core samples, photographing what they saw and collecting rocks. 

{{video|filename=A11v 1094228.ogg|title=Buzz Aldrin steps onto the Moon|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

They planned placement of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP) and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through ''Eagle'''s twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60° field of view. Preparation
required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong had some initial difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his [[Portable Life Support System|PLSS]]. According to veteran moonwalker [[John W. Young|John Young]], a redesign of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] to incorporate a smaller hatch was not followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so some of the highest heart rates recorded from ''Apollo'' astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.

[[Image:As11-40-5903HR.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Buzz Aldrin]] poses on the [[Moon]] allowing [[Neil Armstrong]] to photograph both of them using the visor's reflection.]]

The Remote Control Unit controls on Armstrong's chest prevented him from seeing his feet. While climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against ''Eagle'''s side and activate the TV camera. The first images used a [[Slow-scan television]] system and were picked up at [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] in the USA but with better fidelity by [[Honeysuckle Creek]] in Australia. Minutes later the TV was switched to normal television, and the feed was switched to the more sensitive [[radio telescope]] station at the [[Parkes Observatory]] in [[Australia]]. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and were immediately broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. 

After describing the surface (&quot;very fine grained... almost like a powder&quot;), Armstrong stepped off ''Eagle'''s footpad and into history as the first human to set foot on another world. He reported that moving in the Moon's gravity, one-sixth of Earth's, was &quot;perhaps even easier than the simulations.&quot;

In addition to fulfilling President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s, ''Apollo 11'' was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He then collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. He removed the TV camera from the MESA, made a panoramic sweep, and mounted it on a tripod 12 m (40 ft) from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA. 

[[Image:Apollo 11 plaque closeup on Moon.jpg|right|thumb|Photo of the actual plaque left on the moon (attached to the ladder of the LM Descent Stage).]]

Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backwards, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into ''Eagle'''s shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, though the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow. 

[[Image:Apollo 11 launch.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A visible shockwave formed as the [[Saturn V]] encountered Maximum Dynamic Pressure (Max Q) at about 1 minute 20 seconds into the flight (altitude 12.5 km, 4 km downrange, velocity 440m/s).]]

Together the astronauts planted the U.S. flag, then took a phone call from President [[Richard Nixon]]. 

The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits, the integrated thermal meteoroid garment.

They deployed the EASEP, which included a passive seismograph and a laser ranging retroreflector. Then Armstrong loped about 120 m (400 ft) from the LM to snap photos at the rim of East Crater while Aldrin collected two core tubes. He used the geological hammer to pound in the tubes - the only time the hammer was used on ''Apollo 11''. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documented sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 min. 

[[image:as11-40-5886.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Neil Armstrong works at the LM in one of the few photos taken of him from the lunar surface. NASA photo as11-40-5886]]

During this period Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. Rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, however, so Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.

===Lunar ascent and return===
Aldrin entered ''Eagle'' first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing more than 22 kg (48 lb) of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. 

After transferring to LM [[life support]], the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one [[Hasselblad]] camera, and other equipment. Then they lifted off in ''Eagle''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s ascent stage to rejoin CMP Michael Collins aboard ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit.  ''Eagle'' was jettisoned and left in lunar orbit. Later NASA reports mentioned that ''Eagle''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s orbit had decayed resulting in it impacting in an &quot;uncertain location&quot; on the lunar surface.

After more than 2&amp;frac12; hours on the lunar surface, they returned to Collins on board ''Columbia'', bringing 20.87 kilograms of lunar samples with them. The two Moon-walkers had left behind scientific instruments such as a [[retroreflector]] array used for the [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]].  They also left an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] and other mementos, including a [[lunar plaques|plaque]] (mounted on the LM Descent Stage ladder) bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and [[Richard Nixon]].  The inscription read:

:''Here Men From Planet Earth&lt;br&gt;First Set Foot Upon the Moon&lt;br&gt;July 1969 A.D.&lt;br&gt;We Came in Peace For All Mankind.''

The astronauts returned to earth on [[July 24]], welcomed as [[hero]]es. The splashdown point was {{coor dm|13|19|N|169|9|W|}}, 2,660 km (1,440 [[nautical mile|nm]]) east of [[Wake Island]], or 380 km (210 nm) south of [[Johnston Atoll]], and 24 km (15 [[statute mile|mi]]) from the recovery ship, [[USS Hornet (CV-12)|''USS Hornet'']].   

The command module is displayed at the [[National Air and Space Museum]], [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Contingency television address==
The [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in Washington, D.C. has a copy of the following contingency memo titled &quot;In Event of Moon Disaster&quot; and  dated [[July 18]], [[1969]], which was prepared by [[William Safire]] for President Nixon to read on television, in the event the ''Apollo 11'' astronauts were stranded on the Moon.

:''&quot;Fate has ordained that the men who went to the Moon to explore in peace will stay on the Moon to rest in peace. These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin, know that there is no hope for their recovery. But they also know that there is hope for mankind in their sacrifice.''

:''These two men are laying down their lives in mankind's most noble goal: the search for truth and understanding. They will be mourned by their families and friends; they will be mourned by their nation; they will be mourned by the people of the world; they will be mourned by a Mother Earth that dared send two of her sons into the unknown.''

:''In their exploration, they stirred the people of the world to feel as one; in their sacrifice, they bind more tightly the brotherhood of man. In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.''

:''Others will follow, and surely find their way home. Man's search will not be denied. But these men were the first, and they will remain the foremost in our hearts.''

[[Image:Armstrong_16mm.jpg |thumb|right|250px|Armstrong on lunar surface with gold visor raised. From [[16 mm]] film (NASA).]]

:''For every human being who looks up at the Moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind.&quot;''

The last line of the statement is reminiscent of a [[Rupert Brooke]] poem called &quot;The Soldier&quot;. The poem starts:

:''If I should die, think only this of me:&lt;br&gt;That there's some corner of a foreign field&lt;br&gt;That is forever England.'' 

Following this address, radio communications with the moon would have been cut off, the astronauts left alone to die, while a clergyman was to commend their souls to &quot;the deepest of the deep&quot; in the fashion of a burial at sea.

==Communications link==
Early in the planning of the [[Project Apollo]], NASA decided to combine all communications between spacecraft and Earth into a single multiplexed feed called 'The Unified S-Band System', including audio communications, television images, crew medical telemetry and the spacecraft systems telemetry.

The signal was picked up by three purpose-built stations (Goldstone (California), Honeysuckle Creek (Australia) and Fresnedillas (Spain) and backed-up by deep space network stations (known as 'wing stations') in Australia, Spain and the United States. At first, the signal was routed to Greenbelt, Maryland, by way of submarine telephone cables, using twelve voice circuits. The signal was divided into twelve parts using inverse multiplexing, sent onto the circuits, and reintegrated in Maryland, before being sent on to NASA in Houston.

Intelsat satellites began taking over the trans-oceanic transmissions toward the end of the 1960s, and NASA ended its contracts for the submarine telephone circuits, which were then reallocated by telephone administrations for normal voice use.

On [[14 July]] [[1969]], the Intelsat satellite over the Atlantic failed. A replacement was launched on 16 July, but went into a useless orbit and would not be reoriented in time to be used. The [[Early Bird]] satellite was activated, but thought it might not have enough power to get a signal to the United States. The Australia station was vital to picking up the signal during the moonwalks, or keeping the astronauts waiting on the moon eight hours before venturing out. A communications team was dispatched to Spain to begin setting up the telephone circuits for NASA's inverse multiplexed signal.

European telecommunications administrators, mostly government post offices, were not accustomed to doing the business required: they would normally require telegram messages to be exchanged, with top level administrative approval, but the twelve circuits had to be recovered from six countries to be made available to NASA, which had set a time limit two hours before launch, or the launch would be canceled. It would be the last ideal launch window before 1970. Other launch windows had been missed due to spacecraft equipment problems. An official with the Spanish communications authority helped the team secure the circuits with his own personal list of contacts.

The last circuit using inverse multiplexing was accepted by NASA just minutes before the time limit. Three days later, the transmissions from the Moon were picked up in Spain, relayed to the United States over the undersea circuits, and made available by NASA to the Americas. They were beamed across the Pacific Ocean, and from the Far East were carried on the Indian Ocean satellite.

The postal/telephone authority in West Germany turned a large radio dish to aim at the Indian Ocean satellite, picking up the signal from Australia and providing it to Western Europe, therefore, viewers in Western Europe saw Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon a full half second later than those in the United States, and some 1.8 seconds after it actually happened.

Had this vital communications link not been restored, the pledge of President [[John F. Kennedy]] to land a man on the moon by the end of the decade would have been missed.

==Mission trivia and urban legends==
===Trivia===
* Some internal NASA planning documents referred to the callsigns of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|CSM]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] as &quot;Snowcone&quot; and &quot;Haystack&quot;; these were quietly changed before being announced to the press.
* Shortly after landing, before preparations have begun for the [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]], Aldrin broadcast that -
::''This is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.''
:He then took [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]], privately. At this time, NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] (who had objected to the ''[[Apollo 8]]'' crew reading from the [[Genesis (Old Testament)|Book of Genesis]]), which demanded that their astronauts refrain from religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin (an [[Episcopalian]]) chose to refrain from directly mentioning this. He had kept the plan quiet, not even mentioning it to his wife, and did not reveal it publicly for several years.
* Several books indicate that early mission timelines had Buzz Aldrin, not Neil Armstrong, as the first man on the Moon.
* A replica of the footprint left by Neil Armstrong is located in Tranquility Park in [[Houston, Texas]]; the park was dedicated in 1979, a decade after the first moon landing.
* The [[Australia]]n movie, ''[[The Dish]]'' (2000), tells the (slightly fictionalised) story of how the images of the moon-walk were received by the [[radio telescope]] at [[Parkes Observatory]], [[New South Wales]].
* According to the [[HBO]] [[mini-series]] ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (HBO)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] made the following suggestion as to what Armstrong should say upon stepping onto the lunar surface: &quot;If you had any balls, you'd say 'Oh, my God, what is [[extraterrestrial life|that thing]]?' then scream and cut your [[microphone|mic]].&quot;
* Armstrong claims to have said &quot;That's one small step for ''a'' man, one giant leap for mankind.&quot;, although the &quot;''a''&quot; is not at all clear in recordings made at ground control. It has been pointed out that the audio and video links were somewhat intermittent (partly due to storms near [[Parkes Observatory]]). Recently, digital analysis of the tape by NASA revealed the &quot;a&quot; may have been spoken, but obscured by static.[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_362]

===Folklore===
*At some point while on the moon Armstrong supposedly said &quot;Good luck Mr. Gorski&quot;.  Some years later Gorski died, so he felt he could now explain this remark.  As a boy, he heard a couple next door arguing, and the wife said: &quot;Oral sex?  Is it oral sex you want?  You'll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon, Mr. Gorski!&quot;  This story is untrue. [http://www.snopes.com/quotes/mrgorsky.htm]
* Neil Armstrong apparently took a [[tartan]] where no tartan had been worn before. A tiny swatch of the [[Scottish clan|Clan]] Armstrong plaid was affixed to his suit when he walked on the Moon. Another item that Armstrong took with him was a special diamond-studded [[astronaut pin]] which was given to [[Deke Slayton]] by the widows of the ''[[Apollo 1]]'' crew.  The pin had been intended to be flown in ''Apollo 1'', then given to Deke after the mission, but due to the disaster, the widows ended up giving the pin to him after the funerals.  Deke gave the pin to Neil to leave at Tranquility Base.  
* Two main [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] surround the mission.
** Firstly that the [[Apollo moon landing hoax accusations|landing was a hoax]]. This is generally discounted, although it has slowly grown in popularity, particularly since the release of the movie ''[[Capricorn One]]'' (1978), which portrays a NASA attempt to fake a landing on Mars.
** Secondly, a less well known [[urban legend]] suggests that they were being 'watched' while on the Moon, and had seen alien vehicles there. This grew in popularity after the book ''Someone else is on our Moon'' was published.
*According to another legend, a survey undertaken in the 1980s in [[Morocco]] revealed that a substantial percentage didn't think man had landed on the Moon; this was not due to conspiracy theory, but rather to that segment not having been informed.

'''''Apollo 8''''' was the second [[Human spaceflight|manned mission]] of the [[Project Apollo|Apollo space program]],  in which Commander [[Frank Borman]], Command Module Pilot [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]] and Lunar Module Pilot [[William Anders]] became the first humans to leave [[Low Earth orbit|Earth orbit]] and to orbit around the [[Moon]]. It was also the first manned launch of the [[Saturn V]] [[rocket]].

NASA prepared for the mission in only four months. The hardware involved had only been used a few times—the Saturn V had launched only twice before, and the Apollo spacecraft had only just finished its first manned mission, ''[[Apollo 7]]''. However, the success of the mission paved the way for the successful completion of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of landing on the Moon before the end of the decade.

After launching on [[December 21]], [[1968]], the crew took three days to travel to the Moon, which they orbited for 20 hours. While in lunar orbit they made a [[Christmas Eve]] television broadcast. This was one of the most watched broadcasts of all time.

==Planning==
On [[December 22]], [[1966]], [[NASA]] announced the crew for the third manned Apollo flight: Frank Borman, [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] and Bill Anders. Collins was replaced by his backup Jim Lovell, in July 1968, after Collins had to have surgery as he was suffering cervical intervertebral disc herniation — an [[intervertebral disc]] had slipped into the [[spinal cavity]] and required two [[vertebra]]e to be fused together. Collins recovered and went on to be the Command Module Pilot for ''[[Apollo 11]]''.

In September 1967, the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]], proposed a series of missions that would lead up to a manned lunar landing. Seven mission types were outlined, each testing a specific set of components and tasks; each previous step needed to be completed successfully before the next mission type could be undertaken. These were:

'''A''' - Unmanned [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM) test&lt;/br&gt;
'''B''' - Unmanned [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) test&lt;/br&gt;
'''C''' - Manned CSM in [[low Earth orbit]]&lt;/br&gt;
'''D''' - Manned CSM and LM in low Earth orbit&lt;/br&gt;
'''E''' - Manned CSM and LM in an [[ellipse|elliptical]] Earth orbit with an apogee of 4600&amp;nbsp;mi (7400&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/br&gt;
'''F''' - Manned CSM and LM in lunar orbit&lt;/br&gt;
'''G''' - Manned lunar landing

Of all the components of the Apollo system, the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM), which would eventually be used to land on the Moon, presented the most problems. It was behind schedule and when the first model was shipped to [[Cape Canaveral]] in June 1968, over 101 separate defects were discovered. [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation]], which was the lead contractor for the LM, predicted that the first mannable LM, to be used for the D mission, would not be ready until at least February 1969, delaying the entire sequence.

[[Image:Apollo-linedrawing.png|thumb|Apollo CSM diagram (NASA)]]
[[George Low]], the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, proposed a solution in August. Since the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM) would be ready three months before the Lunar Module, they could fly a CSM-only mission in [[December]] [[1968]]. But instead of just repeating the flight of ''[[Apollo 7]]'', the C mission that would fly the CSM in Earth orbit, they could send the CSM all the way to the Moon and maybe even enter into orbit. This mission was dubbed the &quot;C-Prime&quot; mission. This new mission would allow [[NASA]] to test procedures that would be used on the manned lunar landings that would otherwise have to wait until ''[[Apollo 10]]'', the F mission. There were also concerns from the [[CIA]] that the [[Soviets]] were planning their own circumlunar flight for December to upstage the Americans once again (see [[Zond]] program).

[[Image:Ap8-68-HC-70.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The first stage of AS-503 being erected in the VAB on [[February 1]], [[1968]].]]
Almost every senior manager at NASA agreed with this new mission. The only person who needed some convincing was [[James E. Webb]], the NASA administrator. However, outvoted by the rest of the agency, he gave his approval. After leading the agency for eight years, he would resign just four days before the launch of ''Apollo 7'', the first manned Apollo flight.

[[Deke Slayton]], the Director of Flight Crew Operations, decided to swap the crews of the D and E missions. [[James McDivitt]], the original commander of the D mission, has said he was never offered the circumlunar flight but would probably have turned it down, as he wanted to fly the lunar module. Borman, on the other hand, jumped at the chance: his original mission would just have been a repeat of the previous flight, except in a higher orbit. This swap also meant a swap of spacecraft — Borman's crew would now use CSM-103, while McDivitt's crew would use CSM-104.

In the end, the E mission was canceled as most its objectives had been covered by the ''Apollo 8'' and ''Apollo 9'' flights. Mission managers were also confident that ''[[Apollo 10]]'' would also cover the remaining objectives with its lunar orbit flight.

On [[September 9]], the crew entered the [[Space flight simulator|simulators]] to begin their preparation for the flight. By the time the mission flew, the crew would have spent seven hours training for every actual hour of flight. Although all crew members were trained for all aspects of the mission, it was necessary to specialize. Borman, as commander, was given training on controlling the spacecraft during the [[Atmospheric reentry|re-entry]]. Lovell was trained on [[Celestial navigation|navigating]] the spacecraft in case communication was lost with the Earth. Anders was placed in charge of checking the spacecraft was in working order.

It was not until [[November 12]] that a public announcement was made about the change of mission for ''Apollo 8''. Previous to this [[Thomas O. Paine]], the deputy Administrator of NASA, had made a fleeting remark that all options were being considered.

Borman's main concern during the four months leading up to the launch was keeping the flight plan as simple as possible, not accepting any addition that went beyond the simple objectives of performing the first manned Saturn V launch, going to the Moon and orbiting it. He made sure that they stayed in lunar orbit only as long as necessary — 10 orbits.

The crew, now living in the crew quarters at [[Kennedy Space Center]], received a visit from [[Charles Lindbergh]] the night before the launch. They talked about how before his flight, Lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from [[New York]] to [[Paris]] on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight. The total was a tenth of the amount that the Saturn V would burn every second.

==The Saturn V==
{{main|Saturn V}}
[[Image:Ap8-KSC-68PC-147.jpg|thumb|300px|The ''Apollo 8'' Saturn V being rolled out to [[Pad 39A]].]]
The Saturn V rocket used by ''Apollo 8'' was designated SA-503, the third flight model. When it was erected in the [[Vertical Assembly Building]] &lt;!-- Editor's Note: At that time it was called the Vertical Assembly Building --&gt;on [[20 December]], [[1967]], it was thought that the rocket would be used for an unmanned test flight carrying a [[boilerplate]] Command/Service Module. Although ''[[Apollo 6]]'' had suffered several major problems (it suffered severe [[pogo oscillation]] during its first stage and two second stage engines shutdown early), [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], in charge of the Saturn V, was confident that it could solve all the issues without the need for another unmanned test flight. The SA-503 mission was thus changed to a manned one.

However, NASA managers did impose some restrictions on a manned flight taking place: the [[S-II]] second stage had to undergo [[cryogenic]] testing at the [[Mississippi Test Facility]] and other changes were to be made to &quot;man-rate&quot; the vehicle. So on [[April 30]], the Saturn V was unstacked and the [[S-II|S-II second stage]] shipped by barge to the test site. The spark igniters on the second and third stage engines were also modified. In May 1968 a leak was found in a first stage engine, requiring it to be replaced.

With only two launches of the Saturn V under its belt, the ground crew at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) was having problems keeping to the schedule. The Grumman crew was also having issues with the lunar module. Concern was expressed at the fact so much work had to be done on the lunar module after it had shipped to the Cape. The ascent engine developed leaks that caused redesigns and valve changes.

Then in August 1968, the entire mission changed. SA-503 would launch men to the Moon and would not be carrying a lunar module, instead carrying a mass equivalent, called a lunar module test article (LTA), similar to ones used for ''[[Apollo 4]]'' and ''[[Apollo 6]]''. In order to speed up the pre-launch preparations, much of the modification of the Saturn V was taken out of the hands of KSC and given to appropriate development centers; only changes that affected crew safety were made. 

The ''Apollo 8'' spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on [[September 21]] and the rocket made the slow 3-mile (5 km) journey to the launch pad on [[9 October]]. Testing continued all through December until the day before launch.

The SA-503 designation stood for Saturn-Apollo, and was used by NASA departments concerned with the launch vehicle. However, departments concerned with the manned flight often used AS-503, standing for Apollo-Saturn; both of these designations were used at the time to refer to the mission as a whole. The -503 number indicated that it was flight number ''3'' (5'''03''') of the Saturn ''V'' ('''5'''03).

==The mission==
===Launch and trans-lunar injection===
[[Image:Ap8-KSC-68PC-329.jpg|thumb|250px|''Apollo 8'' launch. The photo is a [[double exposure]], as the Moon was not visible at the time of launch (NASA)]]
''Apollo 8'' launched at 7:51:00 a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]] on [[December 21]], [[1968]]. The entire launch phase was practically flawless with only minor problems. The [[S-IC|S-IC first stage]]'s engines underperformed by 0.75%, causing the engines to burn for 2.45 seconds longer than planned. Towards the end of the second stage burn, the rocket underwent [[pogo oscillation]]s that Frank Borman estimated were of the order of 12 [[Hertz|Hz]] and about ±0.25 [[gee|g]] (±2.5 m/s&amp;sup2;). The first manned Saturn V placed the spacecraft into a 112.8 mi by 118.9 mi (181.5 km by 191.3 km) Earth orbit with a period of 88 minutes and 10 seconds. The [[apogee]] was also slightly higher than intended, with a planned circular orbit of 115 mi (185 km). The S-IC impacted the Atlantic Ocean at {{coor dm|30|12|N|74|7|W|}} and the S-II at {{coor dm|31|50|N|37|17|W|}}.
{{listen|filename=Apollo 8 liftoff.ogg|title=Launch of Apollo 8|description=Air-to-ground transmissions from T-15 seconds to T+3 minutes|format=[[Ogg]]}}

For the next 2 hours and 38 minutes the crew and Mission Control worked to check that the spacecraft was in working in order and ready for Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI), the burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the Moon. At the same time the crew transformed the capsule from a rocket payload to a spacecraft. And the [[S-IVB]] third stage had to be in working order. On the previous unmanned test, the S-IVB had failed to re-ignite. 

During the flight there would be three [[capsule communicator]]s (usually referred to as &quot;capcoms&quot;) on a rotating roster. These were the only people who would normally communicate with the crew. [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] was the first of these on duty and at 2 hours, 27 minutes and 22 seconds after launch radioed &quot;''Apollo 8''. You are Go for TLI&quot;. Mission Control had given official permission for the crew to go to the moon. Over the next twelve minutes before the burn, the crew continued to monitor the spacecraft and the rocket. The [[S-IVB|S-IVB third stage]] rocket ignited on time and burned perfectly for 5 minutes and 17 seconds. The burn increased the velocity of the spacecraft to 35,505 ft/s (10,822 m/s) and their altitude at the end of the burn was 215.4 mi (346.7 km). They were the fastest humans in history.
{{listen|filename=Apollo 8 go for TLI.ogg|title=Go for TLI|description=Capsule communicator Michael Collins gives the crew of ''Apollo 8'' a 'go' for Trans-Lunar Injection|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Now that the S-IVB had performed its required tasks it was jettisoned. The crew then rotated the spacecraft to take some photographs of the spent stage, as well as practiced flying in formation with it. As the crew rotated the spacecraft around they had their first views of the Earth as they moved away from it. This was the first time humans had been able to see the entire Earth in one go. 

Borman became worried that the S-IVB was staying too close to the CSM and suggested to Mission Control that the crew perform a separation maneuver. Mission Control at first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards Earth and using the Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters on the Service Module to add 3 ft/s (0.9 m/s) away from the Earth, but Borman did not want to lose sight of the S-IVB. After much discussion it was decided to burn in this direction anyway but at 9 ft/s (2.7 m/s). These discussions ended up putting the crew an hour behind their flight plan.

Five hours after launch, mission control commanded the S-IVB booster to vent its remaining fuel through its engine bell to change its trajectory such that it would flyby the Moon and enter into a solar orbit, so as to pose no future hazard to the crew. It went into a 0.99 by 0.92 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] solar orbit with an [[inclination]] of 23.47° and a period of 340.80 days.

The members of the ''Apollo 8'' crew were the first humans to pass through the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, which extend up to 15,000 mi (25,000 km) from Earth. Although it was predicted that the passage through the belts would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest [[X-ray]] or 1 [[Gray (unit)|milligray]] (during the course of a year, the average human receives a dose of 2 to 3 mGy), there was still interest in the radiation dosages on the crew. So each crewmember wore a Personal Radiation [[Dosimeter]] that could be read back to the ground as well as three passive film dosimeters that show the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew. By the end of the mission, the average radiation dose of the crew was 1.6 mGy.

===Coasting to the Moon===
[[Image:As08-16-2593.jpg|thumb|250px|One of the first images taken by humans of the whole Earth. Probably photographed by [[Bill Anders]]. South is up with [[South America]] in the middle]]
Jim Lovell's main job as Command Module Pilot was to act as [[navigator]]. Although Mission Control performed all the actual navigation calculation, it was necessary that in case of communication loss the crew could navigate their way home. This was done by star sightings using a [[sextant]] built into the spacecraft, measuring the angle between a star and the Earth's (or the Moon's) [[horizon]]. This proved to be difficult, as the venting by the S-IVB had caused a large cloud of debris to form around the spacecraft, making it hard to distinguish what were the actual stars. 

By seven hours into the mission, the delay in moving away from the S-IVB and Lovell's star sightings meant that they were behind schedule on the flight plan by about one hour and 40 minutes. The crew now placed the spacecraft into Passive Thermal Control (PTC), or what is more aptly called [[barbecue]] mode. This had the spacecraft roll about one rotation per hour, along its long axis in order to ensure even [[heat distribution]] of the spacecraft. In direct sunlight, the spacecraft could be heated to over 200 °C while the parts in shadow would be -100 °C. These temperatures could cause the [[heat shield]] to crack or propellant lines to burst. As it was impossible to get a perfect roll, the spacecraft actually swept out a [[Conical surface|cone]] as it rotated. This would have to be trimmed every half hour as it started to get larger and larger.

The first mid-course correction came 11 hours into the flight. Testing on the ground had shown there was a small chance that the [[Service Propulsion System]] (SPS) engine would explode when burned for long periods unless its [[combustion chamber]] was 'coated' first. This could be done by burning the engine for a short period. This first correction burn was only 2.4 seconds and added about 20.4 ft/s (6.2 m/s) [[Prograde and retrograde motion|prograde]] (in the direction of travel). This was less than the 24.8 ft/s (7.5 m/s) planned, and the shortfall was due to a bubble of [[helium]] in the [[redox|oxidizer]] lines causing lower than expected fuel pressure, requiring the crew to use the small Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters to make up the shortfall. Two later planned midcourse corrections were cancelled as the trajectory was found to be perfect.

Eleven hours into the flight, the crew had been awake for over 16 hours, having been awakened about 5 hours before launch. So it was time for Frank Borman to start his scheduled 7-hour sleep period. It proved difficult to sleep. NASA had decided that at least one crewmember should be awake at all times to deal with any issues that might arise. But the constant radio chatter with the ground and the air circulation fans made it hard to sleep. As well as this, sleeping in space is a somewhat unnatural experience—you cannot rest your head on a [[pillow]] and Bill Anders said that he would suddenly jolt awake with the sensation that he was falling. 

[[Image:As8-16-2583.jpg|thumb|250px|''Apollo 8'' [[S-IVB]] rocket stage. (NASA)]]
About an hour after starting his sleep period, Borman requested clearance to take a [[Secobarbitol|Seconal]] [[Barbiturate|sleeping pill]], but the pill had little effect. After Borman slept for seven hours fitfully, he awoke feeling ill. He [[vomiting|vomited]] twice, and had a bout of [[diarrhea]] that left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and [[feces]]. The crew cleaned up as best as they could. Borman decided that he did not want the world to know about his medical problems but Lovell and Anders still wanted to tell the ground. They decided to use the Data Storage Equipment (DSE), which could be used by the crew to [[tape recorder|tape voice recordings]] and telemetry, which were then dumped to the ground at high speed. After recording a description of Borman's illness they requested that mission control check the recording, as the crew ''&quot;would like an evaluation of the voice comments&quot;''. 

A conference between the crew and medical personnel was held using the unoccupied second floor control room (there were two identical control rooms in Houston on the second and third floor, of which only one is used during the course of a mission). During a private communication with the crew, it was decided that there was little to worry about and that it was either a [[Gastroenteritis|24-hour flu]] as Borman thought, or just a reaction to the sleeping pill. In fact it is now thought that he was suffering from [[Space Adaptation Syndrome]], which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their [[Labyrinth (inner ear)|vestibular system]] adapts to [[weightlessness]]. It had never arisen on previous spacecraft ([[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]]) as they had been too small to move freely in.

[[Image:Ap8-S68-56531.jpg|thumb|left|250px|In-flight footage of the crew taken while they were in orbit around the Moon. In the center is Frank Borman]]
The cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight, with little happening except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and they were on course. During this time, NASA scheduled a television broadcast for 31 hours after launch. The camera used was 2 kg and broadcast in [[black-and-white]] only, using a [[Video camera tube|Vidicon]] tube. It had two [[lens (optics)|lens]]es: a very [[wide-angle]] (160°) lens and a [[telephoto]] (9°) lens. 

During this first broadcast the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the Earth appeared. However this proved impossible, as the narrow-angle lens was difficult to aim without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at. Also without proper [[filter (optics)|filter]]s, the image became saturated by any bright source. In the end all the crew could do was show the people watching back on Earth a bright blob. After broadcasting for 17 minutes the rotation of the spacecraft took the [[High Gain Antenna]] out of view of the receiving stations on Earth and they ended the transmission with Lovell wishing his mother happy birthday.
{{listen|filename=Apollo 8 Borman describing the Earth.ogg|title=Borman described the Earth|description=Frank Borman describes view of Earth from midway to Moon|format=[[Ogg]]}}

By this time the planned sleep periods had completely been abandoned. 32½ hours into the flight, Lovell went to bed, 3½ hours before he had planned to. A short while later Anders also went to bed after taking a sleeping pill. 

Somewhat strangely the crew were unable to see the [[Moon]] for much of the outward cruise. Three of the five windows had fogged up, due to outgassed oils from the [[silicone]] [[sealant]], and due to the attitude required for the PTC, the Moon was almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft. In fact it was not until the crew had gone behind the Moon that they would be able to see it for the first time.

A second television broadcast came at 55 hours. This time the crew had managed to rig up [[filter (optics)|filter]]s meant for the still cameras, so that they could acquire images of the Earth through the [[telephoto]] lens. Although difficult to aim, as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft, the crew was able to broadcast back to Earth the first [[television]] pictures of the Earth. The crew spent the transmission describing the Earth and what was visible and the colors that could be seen. The transmission lasted 23 minutes.

===Lunar sphere of influence===
At about 55 hours and 40 minutes into the flight, the crew of ''Apollo 8'' became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body. Or to put it another way, the Moon's [[gravitational force]] became stronger than that of the Earth. At the time it happened, they were 38,759 mi (62,377 km) from the Moon and had a speed of 3,990 ft/s (1,216 m/s) with respect to the Moon. This historic moment was of little interest to the crew as they still calculated their [[trajectory]] with respect to the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and would do so until they performed their last midcourse correction, when they would switch to a [[reference frame]] based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit. It was only thirteen hours until they would be in lunar orbit.

The last major event before Lunar Orbit Insertion was a second midcourse correction. It was in [[Prograde and retrograde motion|retrograde]] (against direction of travel) and slowed the spacecraft down by 2.0 ft/s (0.6 m/s), in effect lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon. At exactly 61 hours after launch, about 24,200 mi (39,000 km) from the Moon, the crew burned the RCS for 11 seconds. They would now pass 71.7 mi (115.4 km) from the lunar surface.

At 64 hours into the flight, the crew began to prepare for Lunar Orbit Insertion-1 (LOI-1). This maneuver had to be performed perfectly, and due to [[Astrodynamics|orbital mechanics]] had to be on the far side of the Moon, out of contact with the Earth. After Mission Control was polled for a Go/No Go decision, the crew was told at 68 hours, they were Go and ''&quot;riding the best bird we can find&quot;''. At 68 hours and 58 minutes, the spacecraft went behind the Moon and out of radio contact with the Earth.
{{listen|filename=Apollo 8 prior to LOI.ogg|title=''Apollo 8'' goes behind the Moon|description=The last transmissions from the spacecraft before it goes behind the Moon|format=[[Ogg]]}}

With ten minutes before the LOI-1, the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in the correct place. Then they finally got their first glimpses of the Moon. They had been flying over the unlit side, and it was Lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight [[oblique]]ly illuminating the lunar surface. But the burn was only two minutes away so the crew had little time to appreciate the view. 

===Lunar orbit===
Igniting at 69 hours, 8 minutes and 16 seconds after launch, the SPS burned for 4 minutes and 13 seconds, placing the crew of ''Apollo 8'' in orbit around the Moon. The crew described this as being the longest four minutes of their lives. If the burn had not lasted exactly the right amount of time, the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly [[ellipse|elliptical]] lunar [[orbit]] or even flung off into space. If it lasted too long they could have ended up impacting the Moon. After making sure the spacecraft was working, they finally had a chance to look at the Moon, which they would orbit for the next 20 hours.

[[Image:AS8-13-2329.jpg|thumb|250px|The first Earthrise photographed by humans]]
On Earth, Mission Control continued to wait. If the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time the crew would appear early from behind the Moon. However this time came and went without ''Apollo 8'' reappearing. And then exactly at the predicted moment, the signal was received from the spacecraft indicating it was in a 193.3 mi by 69.5 mi (311.1 km by 111.9 km) orbit about the Moon.
{{listen|filename=Apollo 8 first lunar orbit transmissions.ogg|title=''Apollo 8'' appears from behind the Moon|description=First transmissions from ''Apollo 8'' after it has entered into lunar orbit|format=[[Ogg]]}}

After reporting on the status of the spacecraft, Lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like:

:The Moon is essentially grey, no color; looks like [[plaster of Paris]] or sort of a grayish beach sand. We can see quite a bit of detail. The [[Mare Fecunditatis|Sea of Fertility]] doesn't stand out as well here as it does back on Earth. There's not as much contrast between that and the surrounding craters. The craters are all rounded off. There's quite a few of them, some of them are newer. Many of them look like—especially the round ones—look like hit by [[meteorite]]s or projectiles of some sort. [[Langrenus (crater)|Langrenus]] is quite a huge crater; it's got a central cone to it. The walls of the crater are terraced, about six or seven different [[wiktionary:terrace|terrace]]s on the way down.

Lovell continued to describe the terrain that they were passing over. One of the crew's major tasks was [[reconnaissance]] of the planned landing sites on the Moon, especially one in [[Mare Tranquillitatis]] that would be the ''[[Apollo 11]]'' landing site. The launch time of ''Apollo 8'' had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for the site. A [[film camera]] had been set up in one of the windows to record a frame every second of the Moon below. And Bill Anders would spend much of the next 20 hours taking as many photographs as he could of targets of interest. By the end of the mission the crew would take 700 photographs of the Moon and 150 of the Earth. 

[[Image:As8-13-2225.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A portion of the lunar near side. The large crater in the bottom half of the photo is [[Goclenius (crater)|Goclenius]].]]
Throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with the Earth, Borman kept asking how the data for the SPS looked. He wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the Earth if necessary. He also asked that they receive a Go/No Go decision before they passed behind the Moon on each orbit.

As they reappeared for their second pass in front of the Moon, the crew set up the television to broadcast a view of the lunar surface. Anders described the craters that they were passing over. At the end of this second orbit they performed the eleven-second LOI-2 burn of the SPS to circularize the orbit to 70.0 mi by 71.3 mi (112.6 km by 114.8 km).

Over the next two orbits the crew continued to keep check of the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the Moon. During the third pass, Borman read a small [[prayer]] for his [[church]], as he was meant to lay read during the [[Midnight service]] at St. Christopher's [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] Church near [[Seabrook, Texas]] but due to the Apollo 8 flight was unable. A fellow parishioner and engineer at Mission Control, Rod Rose, suggested that Borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service.

It was as the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for its fourth pass across the front that the crew witnessed an event never before seen—Earthrise. Anders glanced out the window and saw a blue and white orb and realized it was the [[Earth]]. Instantly the crew understood that they needed to take a photograph of this. Anders took both the first photograph, which was black-and-white, and then later the more famous color photo. (After the flight, Borman and Anders both claimed they took the first earthrise photo (Lovell also did, but more as a joke than anything else) - it was determined that it was probably Anders.)

[[Image:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|250px|Earth as seen from ''Apollo 8'', December 24, 1968 (NASA)]]
Anders continued to take photographs while Lovell took the controls of the spacecraft so that Borman could get some rest. As always resting was difficult in the cramped and noisy capsule, though Borman was able to [[doze]] for two orbits. He would awaken at times to ask a question about their status, only to be told that everything was going fine. 

Borman did wake up however when he started to hear his fellow crewmembers make mistakes. They were beginning to not understand questions and would have to ask for the answers to be repeated. Borman realized that everyone was extremely tired having not had a good night's sleep in over three days. Taking command, he ordered Anders and Lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the Moon be scrubbed. At first Anders protested saying that he was fine, but Borman would not be swayed. At last Anders agreed as long as the commander would set up the camera to continue to take automatic shots of the Moon. Borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned, and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted to crew to be alert. For the next two orbits Anders and Lovell slept while Borman sat at the helm.

As they rounded the Moon for the ninth time, the second television transmission began. Borman introduced the crew, followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the Moon. Borman described it as being ''&quot;a vast, lonely, forbidding type of existence or expanse of nothing&quot;''. And then after talking about what they were flying over, Anders said that the crew had a message for all those on Earth. 
{{listen|filename=Apollo 8 describing the Moon.ogg|title=''Apollo 8'''s describing the Moon|description=The ''Apollo 8'' crew talk about the Moon and their impressions of it|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Borman closes with: &quot;And from the crew of ''Apollo 8'', we close with, Good night, Good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you, all of you on the good Earth&quot;|format=[[Ogg]]}}

The only thing left for the crew now was to perform the Trans-Earth Injection or TEI, which would occur 2½ hours after the end of the television transmission. This was the most critical burn of the whole flight. If the SPS failed to ignite, then the crew would be stuck in orbit around the Moon, with only about 5 more days of oxygen and no chance of escape. And once again the burn had to be performed while the crew was out of contact with Earth, on the far side of the Moon. 

The burn occurred perfectly on time. The spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re-emerged from behind the Moon at 89 hours, 28 minutes, and 39 seconds, the exact time predicted. When voice contact was regained, Lovell announced, &quot;Please be informed, there is a [[Santa Claus]]&quot;, to which [[Ken Mattingly]], the capcom, replied, &quot;That's affirmative, You are the best ones to know&quot;. It was [[Christmas Day]], 1968.

[[Image:AS8-13-2344.jpg|thumb|250px|Rupes Cauchy in eastern Mare Tranquillitatis]]

===Unplanned manual re-alignment===
Later, Lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings, maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard. However, an accidental entry erased some of the computer's memory, which caused the inertial measuring unit (IMU) to think the module was in the same relative position it had been in before lift-off and fire the thrusters to &quot;correct&quot; the module's attitude.

Once the crew realized why the computer had changed the module's attitude, they realized they would have to re-enter data that would tell the computer its real position. It took Lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers, using the thrusters to get the stars [[Rigel]] and [[Sirius]] aligned, and another fifteen minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer.

Sixteen months later, Lovell would once again have to perform a similar manual re-alignment, under more critical conditions, during the ''[[Apollo 13]]'' mission, after that module's IMU had to be turned off to conserve energy. In his 1994 book, ''Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13'' (later re-titled ''Apollo 13'' when the movie based on it, ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' came out), Lovell wrote, &quot;My training [on Apollo 8] came in handy!&quot; In that book he dismissed the incident as a 'planned experiment', requested by the ground crew. However, in subsequent interviews Lovell has acknowledged that the incident was an accident, caused by his mistake, as described in [[Robert Zimmerman (author)|Robert Zimmerman]]'s 1998 book ''Genesis: The Story of Apollo 8''.

===Cruise back to Earth and re-entry===
The cruise back to Earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft. As long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly, the spacecraft would re-enter 2½ days after TEI and [[splashdown]] in the Pacific. 

On Christmas afternoon, the crew made their fifth and final television broadcast. This time they gave a tour of the spacecraft, showing how an astronaut lived in space. When they had finished broadcasting they found a small present from Deke Slayton in the food locker—real [[domesticated turkey|turkey]] with [[stuffing]] and three miniature bottles of [[brandy]] (which remained unopened). There were also small presents to the crew from their wives.

[[Image:Ap8-S68-56310.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''Apollo 8'' Command Module on the deck of the [[USS Yorktown (CV-10)|USS ''Yorktown'']].]]
After two uneventful days the crew prepared for re-entry. The computer would control the re-entry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude, blunt end forward. If the computer broke down, Borman would take over.

After separating from the Service Module, all the crew could do was sit and wait. Six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere, the crew saw the Moon rising above the Earth's horizon, just as had been predicted by the trajectory specialists. As they hit the thin outer atmosphere they noticed it was becoming hazy outside as glowing [[Plasma physics|plasma]] formed around the capsule. The capsule started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at 6 g (59 m/s&amp;sup2;). With the computer controlling the descent by changing the [[Aircraft attitude|attitude]] of the capsule, ''Apollo 8'' rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean. At 30,000 feet (9 km) the drogue parachute stabilized the spacecraft and was followed at 10,000 feet (3 km) by the three main parachutes. The spacecraft splashdown position was estimated to be {{coor dm|8|6|N|165|1|W|}}.

When it hit the water, the parachutes dragged the spacecraft over and left it upside down, in what was termed Stable 2 position. As they were buffeted by a 10-foot (3 m) swell, Borman was sick, waiting for the three floatation balloons to right the capsule. It was 43 minutes after splashdown before the first [[frogman]] from the [[USS Yorktown (CV-10)|USS ''Yorktown'']] arrived, as the capsule had landed before sunrise. Forty-five minutes later they were on the deck of the aircraft carrier. 

The command module is now displayed at the [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] [[Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago|Museum of Science and Industry]], along with a collection of personal items from the flight donated by Lovell and Frank Borman's spacesuit. Jim Lovell's spacesuit can be found at NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]].

==Historical importance==
''Apollo 8'' came at the end of 1968, a year that had seen much upheaval around the world. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] tanks had put a stop to the [[Prague Spring]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]; [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]] had been assassinated; the [[Vietnam War]] had escalated with the [[Tet Offensive]]; University campuses across the [[United States]] had seen rioting and occupation of buildings by students; [[May 1968|May]] had seen rioting in [[Paris]] that almost led to revolution.

Yet over all these other events, [[TIME|TIME magazine]] chose the crew of ''Apollo 8'' as their [[Person of the Year|Men of the Year]] for 1968, recognizing them as the people that most influenced events in the preceding year. They had been the first people to ever leave the gravitational influence of the Earth and orbit another celestial body. They had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as only having a fifty-fifty chance of fully succeeding. The effect of ''Apollo 8'' can be summed up by a [[Telegraphy|telegram]] from a stranger, received by Borman after the mission, that simply stated, &quot;Thank you ''Apollo 8''. You saved 1968.&quot;

One of the most famous aspects of the flight was the Earthrise picture that was taken as they came around for their fourth orbit of the Moon. Although it was not the first image taken of the whole Earth nor would it be the last, this was the first time that humans had taken such a picture. Some regard the picture as being the start of the [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] movement, with the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970.[http://ipp.nasa.gov/innovation/Innovation_84/wnewview.html]

The mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first American orbital flight, [[Mercury Atlas 6]] by [[John Glenn]] in 1962. There were 1200 journalists covering the mission, with the [[BBC]] coverage being broadcast in 54 countries in 15 different languages. The Soviet newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' even covered the flight without the usual anti-American editorializing. It is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saw — either live or delayed — the Christmas Eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the Moon; it had a tremendous impact. Touring the world after the mission, Borman met with [[Pope Paul VI]]; he was told &quot;I have spent my entire life trying to say to the world what you did on Christmas Eve.&quot;

The militant [[atheist]] [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against NASA over the reading from ''Genesis''; she wished the courts to ban US astronauts—who were all Government employees—from public prayer in space. This was eventually rejected by the courts, but it caused NASA to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the Apollo program. [[Buzz Aldrin]], on ''[[Apollo 11]]'', took [[Eucharist|communion]] on the surface of the moon after landing; he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years, and only obliquely referred to it at the time.

==Crew==
*[[Frank Borman]] (flew on ''[[Gemini 7]]'' &amp; ''Apollo 8''), commander
*[[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]] (flew on ''[[Gemini 7]]'', ''[[Gemini 12]]'', ''Apollo 8'' &amp; ''[[Apollo 13]]''), command module pilot
*[[William Anders]] (flew on ''Apollo 8''), lunar module pilot

As a note, astronaut [[Michael Collins]], who flew aboard the [[Gemini 10]] mission, was originally slated to fly aboard Apollo 8 as Command Module pilot.  A [[bone spur]] in his neck that required surgery grounded Collins, requiring Jim Lovell to fly in Collins' place.  In early 1969, Collins was reinstated to active flight status, and replaced Fred Haise on the Apollo 11 prime crew as Command Module pilot, while Edwin Aldrin became lunar module pilot.  Haise became the backup LM pilot for Apollo 11.

===Backup crew===
The backup crew trained to take the place of the prime crew in case of illness or death.
*[[Neil Armstrong]], (flew on ''[[Gemini 8]]'', ''[[Apollo 11]]''), commander
*[[Edwin E. Aldrin]], (flew on ''[[Gemini 12]]'', ''[[Apollo 11]]''), command module pilot
*[[Fred Haise]], (flew on ''[[Apollo 13]]''), lunar module pilot

===Support crew===
The support crew were not trained to fly the mission but were able to stand in for astronauts in meetings and be involved in the minutiae of mission planning, while the prime and backup crews trained. They often also served as capcoms during the mission.
*[[John S. Bull|John Bull]] (never flew in space)
*[[Vance Brand]] (flew on ''[[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]'', ''[[STS-5]]'', ''[[STS-41-B]]'', ''[[STS-35]]''
*[[Gerald Carr]] (flew on ''[[Skylab 4]]'')
*[[Ken Mattingly]] (flew on ''[[Apollo 16]]'', ''[[STS-4]]'', ''[[STS-51-C]]'')

An '''astronaut''', '''cosmonaut''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: космона́вт), '''spationaut''' or '''taikonaut''' (''taikongren'', 太空人) is a person who [[space travel|travels into space]], or who makes a career of doing so. The criteria for determining who has achieved [[human spaceflight]] vary (see [[edge of space]]). In the [[United States]], people who travel above an altitude of 50 miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) are designated as astronauts. The [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] defines spaceflight as over 100 km (61 miles). As of [[October 12]], [[As of 2005|2005]], a total of 448 humans have reached space according to the U.S. definition, 442 people qualify under the FAI definition, while 438 people have reached [[Earth]] orbit or beyond. These individuals have spent over 28,000 crew-days (or a cumulative total of 76.7 years) in space including over 100 crew-days of spacewalks. A person who has traveled in space is said to hold [[astronaut wings]]. Astronauts from at least [[Timeline of astronauts by nationality|34 countries]] have gone into space.

==International variations==
By convention, a space traveller employed by the [[Russian Aviation and Space Agency]] or its [[Soviet space program|Soviet]] predecessor is called a '''cosmonaut'''. &quot;Cosmonaut&quot; is an [[anglicisation]] of the [[Russia]]n word космонавт ''(kosmonavt)'', which in turn derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''kosmos'' (&quot;universe&quot;) and ''nautes'' (&quot;sailor&quot;).

In the [[United States|USA]], a space traveller is called an '''astronaut'''. The term derives from the Greek words ''ástron'' (&quot;star&quot;) and ''nautes,'' (&quot;sailor&quot;). For the most part, &quot;cosmonaut&quot; and &quot;astronaut&quot; are synonyms in all languages, and the usage of choice is often dictated by  political reasons.  However in the United States, the term &quot;astronaut&quot; is typically applied to the individual as soon as training begins, while in Russia, an individual is not labeled a cosmonaut until successful space flight. The first known use of the term was by [[Neil R. Jones]] in his short story ''The Death's Head Meteor'' in [[1930]]. On [[March 14]], [[1995]] astronaut [[Norman Thagard]] became the first American to ride to space on board a Russian launch vehicle, arguably becoming the first American cosmonaut in the process.

[[Europe]]an (outside of the [[UK]]) space travellers are sometimes, especially in [[French language|French]]-speaking countries, called '''spationauts''' (a [[hybrid word]] formed from the [[Latin]] ''spatium'', &quot;space&quot;, and Greek ''nautes'', &quot;sailor&quot;). Apart from the Soviet Union, Europe has not yet produced manned spacecraft, but has sent men and women into space in cooperation with Russia and the United States.

'''Taikonaut''' is sometimes used in English for astronauts from [[China]] by Western news media. The term was coined in May 1998 by Chiew Lee Yih (赵里昱) from [[Malaysia]], who used it first in [[newsgroup]]s. Almost simultaneously, Chen Lan coined it for use in the Western [[mass media|media]] based on the term ''tàikōng'' (太空, literally &quot;great emptiness&quot;), [[Chinese language|Chinese]] for &quot;[[outer space|space]]&quot;. In Chinese itself, however, a single term ''yǔháng yuán'' (宇航员, &quot;universe navigator&quot;) has long been used for astronauts. The closest term using ''taikong'' is a [[colloquialism]] ''tàikōng rén'' (太空人, &quot;space person&quot;), which refers to people who have actually been in space. Official English texts issued by the Chinese government use ''astronaut'' ({{zh-sp|s=航天员|p=hángtiān yuán}}).

==Space milestones==
[[Image:GagarinPortrait.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Yuri Gagarin]] ]]
[[Image:Tereshkova.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Valentina Tereshkova]] ]]

The first attempt ever in human history to use rocket for a spaceflight was done in the [[16th century]] by a Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] official, a skilled stargazer named [[Wan Hu]].&lt;sup&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TECH/space/09/30/china.wanhu/index.html]&lt;/sup&gt; This attempt was not successful.

The first cosmonaut was [[Yuri Gagarin]], who was launched into space on [[April 12]] [[1961]] aboard [[Vostok 1]]. The first woman cosmonaut was [[Valentina Tereshkova]], launched into space in June [[1963]] aboard [[Vostok 6]]. [[Alan Shepard]] became the first American in space in May 1961. [[Vladimir Remek]] became the first non-Soviet European in space in [[1978]] on a Russian [[Soyuz launch vehicle|Soyuz]] rocket. On [[July 23]] [[1980]] [[Pham Tuan]] of Vietnam became the first [[Asian]] in space when he flew aboard [[Soyuz 37]]. Also in 1980, [[Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez]] became the first person of [[African]] descent to fly in space. (The first person born in Africa to fly in space was [[Patrick Baudry]].) In June [[1985]] [[Shannon Lucid]] became the first Chinese born person in space. In [[2002]] [[Mark Shuttleworth]] became the first citizen of an African country to fly in space. On [[15 October]] [[2003]] [[Yang Liwei]] became China's first astronaut on the [[Shenzhou 5]] spacecraft. The first mission to orbit the moon was ''[[Apollo 8]]'' which included [[William Anders]] - who was born in Hong Kong making him the first Asian-born astronaut in [[1968]].

The youngest person to fly in space is [[Gherman Titov]], who was roughly 26 years old when he flew [[Vostok 2]], and the oldest is [[John Glenn]] who was 77 when he flew on [[STS-95]]. The longest stay in space was 438 days by [[Valeri Polyakov]]. [[As of 2005]], the most spaceflights by an individual astronaut was seven, a record held by both [[Jerry L. Ross]] and [[Franklin Chang-Diaz]]. The furthest distance from Earth an astronaut has traveled was 401&amp;nbsp;056&amp;nbsp;km (during the [[Apollo 13]] emergency).

The first non-governmental astronaut was [[Byron K. Lichtenberg]], an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] researcher who flew on [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-9]] in 1983. In [[December 1990]], [[Toyohiro Akiyama]] became the first commercial space‐farer as a reporter for [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] who paid for his flight. The first self‐funded [[space tourist]] was [[Dennis Tito]] on [[28 April]] [[2001]], while the first astronaut to fly on an entirely privately-funded mission was [[Mike Melvill]], on [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P]], though this flight was sub‐orbital.

In the United States, persons selected as astronaut candidates receive silver [[Astronaut wings]]. Once they have flown in space they receive gold Astronaut wings. The [[United States Air Force]] also presents Astronaut wings to its pilots who exceed 50 miles (80 km) in altitude.

== International astronauts ==
[[Image:ZeroG.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Astronauts on the International Space Station. British astronaut [[Michael Foale]] can be seen exercising in the foreground]]

Up until the end of the [[1970s]] only Americans and Soviets were active astronauts. In [[1976]] the Soviets started the [[Intercosmos]] program with a first group of 6 cosmonauts from fellow [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and [[Cuba]], a second group started training in [[1978]]. At about the same time in [[1978]] the [[European Space Agency]] selected 4 astronauts to train for the first [[Spacelab]] mission on board of the [[Space Shuttle]]. In [[1980]] [[France]] started their own selection of astronauts, followed in [[1982]] by [[Germany]], in [[1983]] by the [[Canadian space program]], in [[1985]] by [[Japan]] and [[Italy]] in [[1988]]. Several international payload specialists were selected for the Space Shuttle, and also later for international [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]] missions of Russia. In [[1998]] the [[European Space Agency]] formed a single astronaut corps of 18 by dissolving the former national corps of France, Germany and Italy. The [[United Kingdom]] does not contribute to ESA's [[human spaceflight]] programme and so its citizens must receive training from either the United States or Russia if they wish to become astronauts.

== Astronaut training==

The first astronauts, both in the USA and USSR, tended to be jet fighter pilots, often [[test pilot|test pilots]], from military backgrounds. U.S. military astronauts receive a special qualification badge, known as the [[Astronaut Badge]] upon completion of Astronaut training and participation in a space flight.

== Astronaut deaths ==
[[Image:DickScobee.jpeg|frame|[[Dick Scobee]], commander of the Space Shuttle Challenger during the [[STS-51-L]] mission. ]]
To date, eighteen astronauts have been killed on space missions, and at least ten more have been killed in ground-based training accidents. ''See also: [[space disaster]].''

==Trivia==
Many people who claim the [[Apollo moon landing hoax accusations|Apollo moon landings were faked]] often call the astronauts ''astroNOTs''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''A Modest Proposal: For Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland from Being a Burden to Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick''''', commonly referred to as '''''A Modest Proposal''''', is a [[satire|satirical]] [[pamphlet]] written by [[Jonathan Swift]] in [[1729]]. The work has now become one of the epitomes of satire, and the modern phrase &quot;A modest proposal&quot; derives from the work.

==Theme==

The work is written in [[first person]] [[Point of view (literature)|point of view]]; however, the narrator should not be confused with Swift himself, because the writer is merely a [[persona]]. He argues, through economic reasoning as well as a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn the problem of squalor among the [[Catholic]]s in [[Ireland]] into its own solution. His proposal is to fatten up the undernourished children and feed them to [[Ireland]]'s rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one thus combating [[overpopulation]] and [[unemployment]], sparing families the expense of child-rearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.

He offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed.

This is widely believed to be the greatest example of sustained [[irony]] in the history of the English language.

==Reactions==
The satirical intent of ''A Modest Proposal'' was misunderstood by many of Swift's peers, and he was harshly criticized for writing prose in such exceptionally &quot;[[Taste (sociology)|bad taste]]&quot;. He came close to losing his [[patronage]] because of this essay. The misunderstanding of the intent of the satirical attack came about largely because of the disparity between the satirical intent of the [[cannibal|cannibalistic]] proposal and the sincere tone of the narrative voice.

==Modern usage==
In modern usage, the phrase &quot;modest proposal&quot; has come to indicate a proposal that is anything but modest.  Such a 'proposal' may serve to advance a cause or [[Logical argument|argument]], by promoting discussion on the merits of the argument's opposite.

The '''alkali metals''' are the [[chemical series|series]] of [[chemical element|elements]] in [[Periodic table group|Group 1]] ([[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] style) of the [[periodic table]] (excluding [[hydrogen]] in all but one [[Metallic_hydrogen|rare circumstance]]): [[lithium]] ('''Li'''), [[sodium]] ('''Na'''), [[potassium]] ('''K'''), [[rubidium]] ('''Rb'''), [[caesium]] ('''Cs'''), and [[francium]] ('''Fr'''). They are all highly reactive and are never found in elemental form in nature.

The alkali metals are silver-colored (caesium has a golden tinge), soft, low-[[density]] [[metal]]s, which react readily with [[halogen]]s to form [[ionic salt]]s, and with [[water (molecule)|water]] to form strongly [[alkali|alkaline]] [[Base (chemistry)|(basic)]] [[hydroxide]]s. These elements all have one [[electron]] in their outermost shell, so the energetically preferred state of achieving a filled [[electron shell]] is to lose one electron to form a singly [[electric charge|charged]] positive [[ion]].  

[[Hydrogen]], with a solitary electron, is sometimes placed at the top of Group 1, but it is not an alkali metal (except under extreme circumstances as [[metallic hydrogen]]); rather it exists naturally as a diatomic [[gas]]. Removal of its single electron requires considerably more energy than removal of the outer electron for the alkali metals.  As in the [[halogen]]s, only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, so hydrogen can in some circumstances behave like a halogen, forming the negative [[hydride]] ion. Binary compounds of hydride with the alkali metals and some [[transition metal]]s have been prepared.

Under extremely high [[pressure]], such as is found at the core of [[Jupiter]], hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal; see [[metallic hydrogen]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[logic]], the '''argument form''' or ''test form'' of an [[logical argument|argument]] results from replacing the different words, or sentences, that make up the argument with letters, along the lines of [[algebra]]; the letters represent logical ''[[variable]]s''. The ''sentence forms'' which classify argument forms of common arguments important are studied in [[college logic]].

Here is an example of an argument:

'''A''' All humans are mortal.  Socrates is human.  ''Therefore'', Socrates is mortal.

We can rewrite argument A by putting each sentence on its own line:

'''B'''
:All humans are mortal.
:Socrates is human.
:''Therefore'', Socrates is mortal.

To demonstrate the important notion of the ''form'' of an argument, substitute letters for similar items throughout '''B''':

'''C'''
:All S are P.
:''a'' is S.
:''Therefore'', ''a'' is P.

All we have done in '''C''' is to put 'S' for 'human' and 'humans', 'P' for 'mortal', and '''a''' for 'Socrates'; what results, '''C''', is the ''form'' of the original argument in '''A'''.  So argument form '''C''' is the form of argument '''A'''.  Moreover, each individual sentence of '''C''' is the ''sentence'' ''form'' of its respective sentence in '''A'''.

Attention is given to argument and sentence form, because ''form is what makes an argument [[validity|valid]] or [[cogency|cogent]]''. Some examples of valid arguments forms are [[modus ponens]], [[modus tollens]], and the [[disjunctive syllogism]]. Two invalid argument forms are [[affirming the consequent]] and [[denying the antecedent]].

An '''alphabet''' is a complete standardized set of ''letters'' &amp;mdash; basic written symbols &amp;mdash; each of which roughly represents a [[phoneme]] of a spoken [[language]], either as it exists now or as it may have been in the past.  There are other [[writing system|systems of writing]] such as [[logogram]]s, in which each symbol represents a [[morpheme]], or word, and [[syllabary|syllabaries]], in which each symbol represents a syllable.

The word &quot;alphabet&quot; itself comes from [[alpha (letter)|alpha]] and [[beta (letter)|beta]], the first two symbols of the [[Greek alphabet]].  There are dozens of alphabets in use today.  Most of them are '[[linear writing|linear]]', which means that they are made up of lines.  Notable [[non-linear writing|exceptions]] are the [[Braille|Braille alphabet]], [[Morse code]] and the [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] alphabet of the ancient city of [[Ugarit]].
{{alphabet}}
==Types==

The term &quot;alphabet&quot; is currently used by linguists both in a wider and in a narrower sense. In the wider sense, the term refers to any script that is segmental on the [[phoneme]] level, i.e. that has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words. In the narrower sense, some scholars distinguish true &quot;alphabets&quot; from two other subtypes, [[abjad]]s and [[abugida]]s. The three types differ from each other in the way vowels are treated in relation to consonants. Abjads record only consonants and leave vowels (or most vowels) unexpressed; in Abugidas the vowels are indicated by diacritical marks or systematic modification of the form of the consonants. In alphabets in the narrow sense, both consonants and vowels have separate symbols. The first alphabet in the wider sense was the [[Proto-Canaanite alphabet]], an [[abjad]], which through its successor [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] became the ancestor of all later alphabets. The first alphabet in the narrow sense was the [[Greek alphabet]].

Examples of present-day abjads are the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew script]]s; true alphabets include [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic]], and Korean [[Hangul]]; and abugidas are used to write [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], and [[Thai language|Thai]]. The [[Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]] are also an abugida rather than a syllabary, as a glyph stands for a consonant and is rotated to represent the vowel, rather than each consonant-vowel combination being represented by a separate glyph, as in a true syllabary. 

The boundaries between these three types are not always clear-cut. For example, Iraqi [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is written in the [[Arabic script]], which is normally an abjad. However, in Kurdish, writing the vowels is mandatory, and full letters are used, so the script is a true alphabet. Other languages may use a Semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics, effectively making them abugidas. On the other hand, the [[Phagspa]] script of the [[Mongol Empire]] was based closely on the [[Tibetan script|Tibetan abugida]], but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks. Although short ''a'' was not written, as in the abugidas, one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet. Conversely, the vowel marks of the [[Amharic_language#Amharic_Abugida_Symbols_.28.22Fidel.22_.E1.8D.8A.E1.8B.B0.E1.88.8D.29|Amharic abugida]] have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the system is learned as a [[syllabary]] rather than as a segmental script. Even more extreme, the Pahlavi abjad became [[logogram|logographic]]. (See below.)

Thus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels. For [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal languages]], further classification can be based on the treatment of tone, though there are as yet no names to distinguish the various types. Some alphabets disregard tone entirely, especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load, as in [[Somali language|Somali]] and many other languages of Africa and the Americas. Such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels. Most commonly, tones are indicated with diacritics, the way vowels are treated in abugidas. This is the case for [[Vietnamese alphabet|Vietnamese]] (a true alphabet) and [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] (an abugida). In Thai, tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant, with diacritics for disambiguation. In the [[Pollard script]] (an abugida), vowels are indicated by diacritics, but the placement of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates the tone.  More rarely, a script has separate letters for the tones, as is the case for [[Hmong pronunciation|Hmong]] and [[Zhuang language|Zhuang]]. For many of these languages, regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used, the most common tone is not marked, just as the most common vowel is not marked in Indic abugidas. 

Alphabets can be quite small. The Book [[Pahlavi]] script, an abjad, had only twelve letters at one point, and may have had even fewer later on. Today the [[Rotokas alphabet]] has only twelve letters. (The [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] alphabet is sometimes claimed to be as small, but it actually consists of 18 letters, including the [[Okina|ʻokina]] and five long vowels.) While Rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent (just eleven), Book Pahlavi was small because many letters had been ''conflated'', that is, the graphic distinctions had been lost over time, and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes. For example, a comma-shaped letter represented ''g, d, y, k,'' and ''j''. However, such simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated. In later Pahlavi [[papyrus|papyri]], up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions were lost, and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all, but had to be learned as word symbols &amp;ndash; that is, as [[logogram]]s like Egyptian [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]].

The largest segmental script is probably an abugida, [[Devanagari]]. When written in Devanagari, Vedic [[Sanskrit]] has an alphabet of 53 letters, including the ''visarga'' mark for final aspiration and special letters for ''kš'' and ''jñ'', though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used. The Hindi alphabet must represent both Sanskrit and modern vocabulary, and so has been expanded to 58 with the ''khutma'' letters (letters with a dot added to represent sounds from Persian and English). 

The largest known abjad is [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], with 51 letters. The largest true alphabets include [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] and [[Abkhaz language|Abxaz]] (for [[Cyrillic]]), with 58 and 56 letters, respectively, and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] (for the [[Latin alphabet]]), with 46. However, these scripts either include di- and tri-graphs, similar to Spanish ''ch'', or [[diacritic]]s, like Slovak ''č''. The largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent is probably [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]], with 41 letters. 

Syllabaries typically include 50 to 400 glyphs (though the [[Múra-Pirahã language]] of [[Brazil]] would require only 24 if tone were not indicated, and Rotokas 30), and the glyphs of logographic systems number from the hundreds to the thousands. Thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script.

It is not always clear what constitutes a distinct alphabet.  [[French language|French]] uses the same basic alphabet as English, but many of the letters can carry [[diacritic]] and other marks (for example, é, à or ô). In French, these marks are not considered to create additional letters.  However, in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], the accented letters (such as á, í and ö) are considered distinct letters of the alphabet.  Some adaptations of the Latin alphabet are augmented with [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], such as [[æ]] in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Ou (letter)|&amp;#546;]] in [[Algonquian language|Algonquian]]; by borrowings from other alphabets, such as the [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] þ in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which came from the [[Futhark]] runes; and by modifying existing letters, such as the [[Eth (letter)|eth]] ð of Old English and Icelandic, which came from ''d''. Other alphabets only use a subset of the Latin alphabet, such as Hawaiian, or [[Italian language|Italian]], which only uses the letters ''j'', ''k'', ''x'', ''y'' and ''w'' for foreign words.

==Spelling==
{{details|Spelling}}

Each language may establish certain general rules that govern the association between letters and phonemes, but, depending on the language, these rules may or may not be consistently followed.  In a perfectly [[phonology| phonological]] alphabet, the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions:  a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling.  However, languages often evolve independently of their writing systems, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.

Languages may fail to achieve a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways:

* A language may represent a given phoneme with a combination of letters rather than just a single letter. Two-letter combinations are called [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s and three-letter groups are called [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s. [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] uses a tesseragraph (four letters) for one of its phonemes.
* A language may represent the same phoneme with two different letters or combinations of letters.
* A language may spell some words with unpronounced letters that exist for historical or other reasons.
* Pronunciation of individual words may change according to the presence of surrounding words in a sentence.
* Different dialects of a language may use different phonemes for the same word.
* A language may use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items (such as the Japanese [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] syllabaries, or the various rules in English for spelling words from Latin and Greek, or the original [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] vocabulary.

National languages generally elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard.  However, with an international language with wide variations in its dialects, such as [[English language|English]], it would be impossible to represent the language in all its variations with a single phonetic alphabet.

Some national languages like [[Finnish language|Finnish]] have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes.  The [[Italian language|Italian]] verb corresponding to 'spell', ''compitare'', is unknown to many Italians because the act of spelling itself is almost never needed: each phoneme of Standard Italian is represented in only one way. However, pronunciation cannot always be predicted from spelling because certain letters are pronounced in more than one way. In standard Spanish, it is possible to tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling, but not vice versa; this is because certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way, but a given letter is consistently pronounced. [[French language|French]], with its [[silent letter]]s and its heavy use of [[nasal vowel]]s and [[elision]], may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, but its rules on pronunciation are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy.  At the other extreme, however, are languages such as English and [[Irish language|Irish]], where the spelling of many words simply has to be memorized as they do not correspond to sounds in a consistent way. For English, this is because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] occurred after the orthography was established, and because English has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times retaining their original spelling at varying levels.  However, even English has general rules that predict pronunciation from spelling, and these rules are successful most of the time.

The sounds of speech of all languages of the world can be written by a rather small universal phonetic alphabet. A standard for this is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].

==Collation==
{{details|Collation}}

An alphabet also serves to establish an ''order'' among letters that can be used for sorting entries in lists, called collating. Note that the order does not have to be constant among different languages using this alphabet; for examples see [[Latin alphabet#Collating in other languages|Latin alphabet: Collating in other languages]].

In recent years the [[Unicode]] initiative has attempted to collate most of the world's known writing systems into a single [[character encoding]]. As well as its primary purpose of standardising computer processing of non-Roman scripts, the Unicode project has provided a focus for script-related scholarship.

==The Alphabet effect==

Some communication theorists (notably those associated with the so-called &quot;Toronto school of communications&quot;, such as [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Harold Innis]] and more recently [[Robert K. Logan]]) have advanced hypotheses to the effect that alphabetic scripts in particular have served to promote and encourage the skills of analysis, coding, decoding, and classification. This set of hypotheses may be known as &quot;the Alphabet effect&quot;, after the title of Logan's [[1986]] work. 

The theory claims that a greater level of abstraction is required due to the greater economy of symbols in alphabetic systems; and this abstraction needed to interpret phonemic symbols in turn has contributed in some way to the development of the societies which use it. Proponents of this theory hold that the development of alphabetic (as distinct to other types of) writing systems has made a significant impact on &quot;Western&quot; thinking and development because it introduced a new level of abstraction, analysis, and classification. McLuhan and Logan (1977) postulates that, as a result of these skills, the use of the alphabet created an environment conducive to the development of codified law, monotheism, abstract science, deductive logic, objective history, and individualism. According to Logan, &quot;All of these innovations, including the alphabet, arose within the very narrow geographic zone between the Tigris-Euphrates river system and the Aegean Sea, and within the very narrow time frame between 2000 B.C. and 500 B.C.&quot; (Logan 2004). 

However, many of these abstractions first occurred in societies which did not use an alphabet, such as the codified law of [[Hammurabi]] in [[Babylonia]], which predated similar codes in societies with the alphabet. Since the alphabet quickly spread to become nearly ubiquitous, it is difficult to trace cause and effect in this matter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], the '''atomic number''' ('''Z''') is the number of [[proton]]s found in the nucleus of an [[atom]]. In an atom of [[neutral|neutral charge]], the number of [[electrons]] ''also'' equals the atomic number.

The atomic number originally meant the number of an element's place in the [[periodic table]]. When [[Dmitriy Mendeleyev|Mendeleyev]] arranged the known [[chemical element]]s grouped by their similarities in chemistry, it was noticeable that placing them in strict order of [[atomic weight|atomic mass]] resulted in some mismatches. [[Iodine]] and [[tellurium]], if listed by atomic mass, appeared to be in the wrong order, and would fit better if their places in the table were swapped. Placing them in the order which fit chemical properties most closely, their number in the table was their atomic number. This number appeared to be approximately proportional to the mass of the atom, but, as the discrepancy showed, reflected some other property than mass. 

The anomalies in this sequence were finally explained after research by [[Henry Moseley|Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley]] in [[1913]]. Moseley discovered a strict relationship between the [[x-ray diffraction]] spectra of elements, and their correct location in the periodic table. It was later shown that the atomic number corresponds to the [[electric charge]] of the nucleus &amp;mdash; in other words the number of protons. It is the charge which gives elements their chemical properties, rather than the atomic mass.

The atomic number is closely related to the [[mass number]] (although they should not be confused) which is the number of protons and [[neutron|neutrons]] in the nucleus of an atom. The mass number often comes after the name of the element, e.g. [[carbon-14]] (used in [[carbon dating]]).

'''Anatomy''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{polytonic|ἀνατομία}} anatomia'', from '' {{polytonic|ἀνατέμνειν}} anatemnein'', to cut up, cut open), is the branch of [[biology]] that deals with the structure and organization of living things. It can be divided into animal anatomy ([[zootomy]]) and plant anatomy ([[phytonomy]]).  Furthermore, anatomy can be covered either regionally or systemically, that is, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest for the former, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systmes for the latter. Major branches of anatomy include [[comparative anatomy]], [[histology]], and [[human anatomy]]. 

==Animal anatomy==
Animal anatomy may include the study of the structure of different animals, when it is called [[comparative anatomy]] or [[animal morphology]], or it may be limited to one animal only, in which case it is spoken of as ''special anatomy''.

==Human anatomy==
From a utilitarian point of view the study of [[human]]s is the most important division of special anatomy, and this human anatomy may be approached from different points of view. 

From that of Medicine it consists of a knowledge of the exact form, position, size and relationship of the various structures of the healthy human body, and to this study the term descriptive or topographical human anatomy is given, though it is often, less happily, spoken of as ''anthropotomy''.

So intricate is the [[human body]] that only a small number of professional human anatomists, after years of patient observation, are complete masters of all its details; most of them specialize on certain parts, such as the brain or viscera, contenting themselves with a good working knowledge of the rest.

''Topographical anatomy'' must be learned by repeated dissection and inspection of dead human bodies.  
It is no more a [[science]] than a pilot's knowledge is, and, like that knowledge, must be exact and available in moments of emergency. 

From the morphological point of view, however, human anatomy is a scientific and fascinating study, having for its object the discovery of the [[morphogenesis|causes]] which have brought about the existing structure of humans, and needing a knowledge of the allied sciences of [[embryology]] or [[developmental biology]], [[phylogeny]], and [[histology]]. 

''[[Anatomical pathology|Pathological anatomy]]'' (or ''morbid anatomy'') is the study of [[disease]]d [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s, while sections of normal anatomy, applied to various purposes, receive special names such as medical, surgical, gynaecological, artistic and superficial anatomy.  
The comparison of the anatomy of different [[race]]s of humans is part of the science of physical anthropology or anthropological anatomy.  
In the present edition of this work the subject of anatomy is treated systematically rather than topographically.  
Each anatomical article contains first a description of the structures of an organ or system (such as [[nerve]]s, [[Artery|arteries]], [[heart]], and so forth), as it is found in humans; this is followed by an account of the development (embryology) and comparative anatomy (morphology), as far as [[Vertebrate|vertebrate animals]] are concerned; but only those parts of the lower animals which are of interest in explaining human body structure are here dealt with.  
The articles have a twofold purpose; first, to give enough details of structure to make the articles on physiology, surgery, medicine and pathology intelligible; and, secondly, to give the non-expert inquirer, or the worker in some other branch of science, the chief theories on which the modern scientific groundwork of anatomy is built.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Affirming the consequent''' is a [[logical fallacy]] in the form of a hypothetical proposition.  Propositionally speaking, Affirming the Consequent is the logical equivalent of assuming the converse of a statement to be true.  The fallacy of affirming the consequent occurs when a hypothetical proposition comprising an [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and a [[consequent]] asserts that the truthhood of the consequent implies the truthhood of the antecedent.  This is fallacious because it assumes a bidirectionality when it does not necessarily exist.

This fallacy has the following [[argument form]]:
:If P, then Q.
:Q.
:Therefore, P.

This logical error is called the fallacy of affirming the consequent because it is mistakenly concluded from the second premise that the affirmation of the consequent entails the truthhood of the antecedent. One way to demonstrate the invalidity is to use a counterexample. Here is an argument that is obviously incorrect:

:If [[Stephen King]] wrote the [[Bible]] (P), then Stephen King is a good writer (Q).
:Stephen King is a good writer (Q).
:Therefore, Stephen King wrote the Bible (P).

The previous argument was obviously incorrect, but the next argument may be more deceiving:

:If someone is human (P), then she is mortal (Q).
:Anna is mortal (Q).
:Therefore Anna is human (P).

But in fact Anna can be a cat; very much a mortal, but not a human one.

However, be aware that a similar [[argument form]] is [[validity|valid]] in which the first premise asserts &quot;[[if and only if]]&quot; rather than &quot;if&quot;.  Similarly, the converse of a statement can be validly assumed to be true so long as the &quot;[[if and only if]]&quot; phrase is attached.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Tarkovsky.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Andrei Tarkovsky]]

'''Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky''' (Андре́й Арсе́ньевич Тарко́вский) ([[April 4]], [[1932]] - [[December 28]], [[1986]]) was a [[Russia]]n movie director, writer, and actor. He is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era in Russia and one of the greatest in the [[history of film|history of cinema]]. 

==Biography==
Tarkovsky, son of the prominent poet [[Arseniy Tarkovsky]], was a product of the golden era of Soviet arts education. He received a classical education in [[Moscow]], studying [[Music]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], before training for over five years at the [[VGIK]] film school, studying directly under [[Mikhail Romm]] among others. 
He also worked as a geologist in Siberia.
Although the [[Orthodox Christian]] symbolism of his films led to prevarication and occasional suppression of the finished product by the Soviet authorities, the Soviet [[Mosfilm]] studio system enabled him to make films that would not have been commercially viable in the West. However, Tarkovsky's principal complaint about his treatment by the authorities was that he had many more ideas in him than he was allowed to bring to the screen, and in [[1984]], after shooting ''[[Nostalghia]]'' in [[Italy]], he decided not to return to Russia. He made only one more film, ''[[The Sacrifice]]'', a European co-production filmed in [[Sweden]], before dying of [[cancer]] in the suburb of [[Paris]] at the early age of 54.

Andrei Tarkovsky was buried in a graveyard for Russian émigrés in the town of [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois]], [[Île-de-France (région)|Île-de-France]], [[France]].

==Work==
Tarkovsky's films are characterised by [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, extremely long takes, and memorable images of exceptional beauty. Recurring motifs in his films are dreams, memory, childhood, running water accompanied by fire, rain indoors, reflections, and characters re-appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera.

Tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called &quot;sculpting in time&quot;. By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it. Unedited movie footage transcribes time in real time. (The speedy jump-cutting style that is prevalent in MTV videos and Hollywood movies, by contrast, overrides any sense of time by imposing the editor's viewpoint.) By using long takes and few cuts in his films, he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, and the relationship of one moment in time to another.

Up to and including his film [[The Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]], Tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory. After Mirror, he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the dramatic unities proposed by [[Aristotle]]: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within the span of a single day. [[The Sacrifice]] is the only film that truly reflects this ambition; it is also considered by many to be a near-perfect reflection of the sculpting in time theory.

==Filmography==
* ''[[The Killers (1958 film)|The Killers]]'' (1958) - Tarkovsky's first student film at VGIK, the Soviet State Film School.
* ''[[Concentrate (1958 film)|Concentrate]]'' (1958) - Tarkovsky's second student film at VGIK, the Soviet State Film School.
* ''[[There Will be No Leave Today]]'' (1959) - Tarkovsky's final student film at VGIK, the Soviet State Film School.
* ''[[The Steamroller and the Violin]]'' (1960) - Tarkovsky's graduation film from VGIK, the Soviet State Film School, cowritten with [[Andrei Konchalovsky]].
* ''[[My Name is Ivan]] / [[Ivan's Childhood]]'' (1962) - Winner of Golden Lion for &quot;Best Film&quot; at [[1962]] [[Venice Film Festival]].  Set in the Second World War, this is Tarkovsky's most conventional feature film, although it still has moments of lyrical beauty.
* ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (1966) - An epic based on the life of [[Andrei Rublev]], the most famous medieval Russian painter of icons.
* ''[[Solaris (film)|Solaris]]'' (1972) - based on the [[science fiction]] [[Solaris (novel)|novel]] by [[Stanisław Lem]]. 
* ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'' (1975) - A loosely autobiographical reconstruction of key scenes in Tarkovsky's life, the film he'd tried to make earlier but abandoned for ''Solaris'' (we can note thematic ties between them). Said by Tarkovsky to be closest to his own vision of cinema.
* ''[[Stalker (film)|Stalker]]'' (1979) - inspired by the novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'' by [[Boris and Arkady Strugatsky]].
* ''[[Tempo di Viaggio/Italian Journey]]'' (1982) - a documentary made for Italian television while scouting locations for [[Nostalghia]] with Italian co-writer (and frequent screenwriter for [[Antonioni |Michelangelo Antonioni]]) [http://imdb.com/name/nm0346096/ Tonino Guerra].
* ''[[Nostalghia]]'' (1983) - A Russian scholar retraces the footsteps of an 18th century Russian composer in Italy.  An encounter with a local lunatic - a man who believes he can save humanity by carrying a lit candle across an empty swimming pool - crystalizes the poet's melancholic sense of longing for his family, faith, and homeland.
* ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' (1986) - The film is about the prospect of nuclear annihilation and man's spiritual response to this and other dilemmas set in counterpoint to a minor fable of failed adultery.

&quot;This word has many meanings...&quot; Dónal Troddyn, A Treatise on Language Vol. 2, 2004

A word, phrase, sentence, or other communication is called '''ambiguous''' if it can be interpreted in more than one way. Ambiguity is distinct from ''[[vagueness]]'', which arises when the boundaries of meaning are indistinct.

'''Lexical ambiguity''' arises when context is insufficient to determine the sense of a single word that has more than one meaning. For example, the word &quot;bank&quot; has several meanings, including &quot;financial institution&quot; and &quot;edge of a river&quot;, but if someone says &quot;I deposited $100 in the bank&quot;, the intended meaning is clear. More problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts. &quot;Good&quot;, for example, can mean &quot;useful&quot; or &quot;functional&quot; (''That's a good hammer''), &quot;exemplary&quot; (''She's a good student''), &quot;pleasing&quot; (''This is good soup''), &quot;moral&quot; (''He is a good person''), and probably other similar things. &quot;I have a good daughter&quot; isn't clear about which sense is intended.

'''[[Syntactic ambiguity]]''' arises when a sentence can be [[parsing|parsed]] in more than one way. &quot;He ate the cookies on the couch&quot;, for example, could mean that he ate those cookies which were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies. Spoken language can also contain lexical ambiguities, where there is more than one way to break up a set of sounds into words, for example &quot;ice cream&quot; and &quot;I scream&quot;. This is rarely a problem due to the use of context.

[[Philosopher]]s (and other users of [[logic]]) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing ambiguity in arguments, because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments.  For example, a politician might say &quot;I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth&quot;. Some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth; others will think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth (although in writing, the correct insertion or omission of a [[comma (punctuation)|comma]] after &quot;taxes&quot; removes ambiguity here). The politician hopes that each will interpret the statement in the way he wants, and both will think the politician is on his side. The logical fallacies of [[amphiboly]] and [[equivocation]] also rely on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.

In [[literature]] and [[rhetoric]], on the other hand, ambiguity can be a useful tool. [[Groucho Marx]]'s classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its [[humor]], for example: ''Last night I shot an elephant in my pajamas. What he was doing in my pajamas I'll never know.''  Songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect, as in the song title &quot;Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&quot; (where &quot;blue&quot; can refer to the color, or to sadness).

In narrative, ambiguty can be introduced in several ways: motive, plot, character. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel [[The Great Gatsby]].           

In [[music]] pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous, such as some [[polytonality]], [[polymeter]], other ambiguous [[metre|meters]] or [[rhythm]]s, and ambiguous [[phrase (music)|phrasing]], or (Stein 2005, p.79) any [[aspect of music]]. The [[music of Africa]] is often purposely ambiguous. To quote Sir [[Donald Francis Tovey]] (1935, p.195), &quot;Theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value.&quot;

Some languages have been created with the intention of avoiding ambiguity, especially syntactic ambiguity. [[Lojban]] and [[Loglan]] are two nearly identical languages which have been created with the intention of being clear and impossible to misunderstand. The languages can be both spoken and written. Their unambiguity makes them better suited than natural languages for use in communication between humans and computers.

The '''Aardvark''' (''Orycteropus afer'') is a medium-sized [[mammal]] native to [[Africa]]. The name comes from the [[Afrikaans]]/[[Dutch language|Dutch]] for &quot;earth pig&quot; (''aarde'' earth, ''varken'' pig), because early settlers from [[Europe]] thought it resembled a [[pig]] (although Aardvarks are not closely related to pigs).

The Aardvark is the only surviving member of the [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Orycteropodidae''' and of the [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Tubulidentata'''. The Aardvark was originally placed in the same [[genus]] as the [[anteater|South American anteater]]s because of superficial similarities which, it is now known, are the result of [[convergent evolution]], not common ancestry. (For the same reason, Aardvarks bear a striking first-glance resemblance to the [[marsupial]] [[Bilby|bilbies]] and [[Bandicoot|bandicoots]] of [[Australasia]], which are not [[Eutheria|placental mammals]] at all.)

The oldest known Tubulidentata fossils have been found in [[Kenya]] and date to the early [[Miocene]]. Although the relationships of Tubulidentata are unknown, they are probably [[Ungulates]]. They spread to Europe and [[southern Asia]] during the later Miocene and early [[Pliocene]] periods. Three genera of the family Orycteropodidae are known: ''Leptorycteropus'', ''Myorycteropus'', and ''Orycteropus'', the surviving Aardvark. A genus from Madagascar may be related to them, called ''Plesiorycteropus''.

The most distinctive characteristic of the Tubulidentata is (as the name implies) their teeth which, instead of having a pulp cavity, have lots of thin tubes of dentine, each containing pulp and held together by cementum. The teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously. Aardvarks are born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw, but these fall out and are not replaced. In adult Aardvarks, the only teeth are the molars at the back of the jaw.

[[Image:Orycteropus afer01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Aardvark]]

Aardvarks are only vaguely pig-like; the body is stout with an arched back; the limbs are of moderate length. The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb')&amp;mdash;resulting in four toes&amp;mdash;but the rear feet have all five toes. Each toe bears a large, robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof. The ears are disproportionately long and the tail very thick at the base with a gradual taper.  The greatly elongated head is set on a short, thick neck, and at the end of the snout is a disk in which the nostrils open.  The mouth is typical of species that feed on termites: small and tubular. Aardvarks have long, thin, protrusible tongues and elaborate structures supporting a keen [[olfaction|sense of smell]].

Weight is typically between 40 and 65 kg; length is usually between 1 and 1.3 m. Aardvarks are a pale yellowish gray in color, often stained reddish-brown by soil. The coat is thin and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin; Aardvarks have been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest, so well does it protect them. 

In the past, several individual species of Aardvark were named, however current knowledge indicates that there is only one species, ''Orycteropus afer'', with several subspecies; 18 have been listed but most are regarded as invalid.

Aardvarks are [[nocturnal]] and solitary creatures that feed almost exclusively on [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s. An Aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home range, swinging its long nose from side to side to pick up the scent of food. When a concentration of ants or termites is found, the Aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long, sticky tongue&amp;mdash;as many as 50,000 in one night has been recorded. They are exceptionally fast diggers, but otherwise move rather slowly. 

Aside from digging out ants and termites, aardvarks also excavate burrows to live in: temporary sites scattered around the home range as refuges, and the main burrow which is used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances, and be 13m long. Aardvarks change the layout of their home burrow regularly, and from time to time move on and make a new one. Only mothers and young share burrows.

After a gestation period of 7 months, a single young weighing around 2 kg is born, and is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks. At six months of age it is digging its own burrows, but it will often remain with the mother until the next [[mating season]]. Aardvarks can grow older than 20 years in captivity.

Aardvarks are distributed across most of [[sub-Saharan Africa]], and although killed by humans both for their flesh and for their teeth (which are used as decorations), do not appear to be threatened.

''Aardvark'' is always the first noun in the English dictionary.

The '''Aardwolf''' (''Proteles cristatus'') is a small [[mammal]] related to the [[Hyena]], native to Africa. The name means &quot;earth wolf&quot; in [[Afrikaans]].

There are two subspecies: 

* ''Proteles cristatus cristatus'' ([[Southern Africa]])
* ''Proteles cristatus septentrionalis'' ([[East Africa]])

The Aardwolf looks most like the [[Striped Hyena]] but smaller with a more pointed [[muzzle]], sharper [[ear]]s, vertical stripes, and a long mane down the middle line of the neck and back. It stands about 50 cm at the shoulder, weighs around 9 kg, and has two glands at the rear that secrete a musky fluid for marking territory and communicating with other aardwolves.

[[Image:Aardwolf.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Aardwolf from the zoo in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]]]

The Aardwolf is nocturnal, sleeping in underground burrows by day. By night, an Aardwolf can consume up to 200,000 harvester [[termites]]. They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, and eggs.

While primarily solitary, a mating pair will occupy the same territory with their young. Gestation lasts between 90 and 100 days. The first six to eight weeks are spent in the den with the mother. After three months, they begin supervised foraging and set off on their own shortly thereafter.

'''Adobe''' is a [[building material]] composed of water, [[sand]]y [[clay]] and  [[straw]] or other organic materials, which is shaped into bricks using wooden frames and dried in the sun, also known as [[Mudbrick]] . Adobe structures are extremely durable and account for the oldest extant buildings on the planet. Adobe buildings also offer significant advantages in hot, dry [[climate]]s, as they remain cooler as it stores and releases heat very slowly.  

The word &quot;adobe&quot; is Spanish and comes from the Arabic &quot;at-tub&quot;, the brick, and from the Coptic &quot;tObe&quot;. The word may be pronounced ah-doh-beh or uh-doh-bee. Buildings made of sun-dried earth are common in [[the Middle East]], [[North Africa]], and in [[Spain]] (usually in the [[Mudejar]] style). The method of brickmaking was imported to the Americas in the [[16th century]] by Spaniards.

A distinction is sometimes made between the smaller ''adobes,'' which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks, and the larger ''adobines,'' some of which are as much as from one to two yards long.

In more modern usage, the term &quot;adobe&quot; has come to mean a style of architecture that is popular in the [[desert]] [[climate]]s of [[North America]], especially in [[New Mexico]].  Cf. [[stucco]].

[[Image:Adobe kilns from HABS.jpg|frame|right|Detail of Adobe kilns in Arizona]]

==Composition of adobe==
An adobe brick is made of soil mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or animal dung. The soil composition typically contains [[clay]] and [[sand]]. Straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly. Dung offers the same advantage and is also added to repel insects.

==Adobe bricks==
Bricks are made in an open frame, 25 cm (10 inches) by 36 cm (14 inches) is a reasonable size, but any convenient size is fine for your own use. After the mud is put into the frame the frame is removed. After a few hours the bricks are put on edge to finish drying. Bricks should be dried in the shade to avoid cracking.

Use the same mixture you use to make bricks for mortar when laying the bricks and for plaster on the interior and exterior walls. Some ancient cultures used concrete for the plaster to avoid rain damage. It is sometimes useful to include occasional pieces of wood as you lay a wall to give something to nail insulation onto, and stone can be used for additional strength.

The largest structure ever made from adobe (bricks), was the [[Bam Citadel]], which suffered serious damage, up to 80%, by an earthquake on December 26, 2003. Other large adobe structures are the [[Huaca del Sol]] in [[Peru]], built using 100 million signed bricks, and the ciudellas of [[Chan Chan]], also in Peru.

==Thermal properties==

Because an adobe wall, either made of bricks or using a [[rammed earth]] technique, is quite massive it will hold heat or cold.  A south facing adobe wall may be left uninsulated in order to collect heat during the day. It should be thick enough that it remains cool on the inside during the heat of the day but should be thin enough that the heat can be transferred through the wall by evening. Such a wall can be covered with glass to increase heat collection. Used in a [[passive solar heating|passive solar]] home, such a wall is called a [[Trombe wall]].   Adobe has a large thermal mass, therefore this type of construction is only good in tropical climates. In temperate climates it is almost impossible to heat a home of this type as the heat is leached by the ground and the walls.

'''Adventure''' refers to events which happen unexpectedly and involve the chance of danger or loss.  Adventures can include daring feats, remarkable occurrences, stirring encounters, and major life undertakings.  

Adventurous experiences create psychological and physiological [[arousal]] which can be interpreted as negative (e.g., [[fear]]) or positive (e.g., [[flow]]) (see [[Yerkes-Dodson law]]).  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself, for example see [[Extreme Sports]].

===Applications of Adventure===

Adventure is a term used in many contexts and situations.  For example, it is a key component of  [[narrative]], [[story-telling]], [[drama]] and [[role-playing]] and the concept is used to structure and interpet [[books]], [[film]]s, music and [[computer games]].  Adventure is also used within [[education]], [[sport]], [[tourism]] and others forms of [[entertainment]].  Examples of these adventure genres and applications include:

* [[Adventure education]] is the use of challenging experiences for learning.
* [[Adventure film]] is a film genre.
* [[Adventure game]] is a computer game genre.
* [[Adventure novel]] is a fiction genre.
* [[Adventure (role-playing games)]] involve acting out a specific storyline or plotline.
* [[Adventure racing]] involves competing in multiple outdoor adventure extreme sports.
* [[Adventure tourism]] offers travellers chances to have exciting travel encounters.

'''Agaves''' are [[succulent plant|succulent]] [[plant]]s of a large botanical genus of the same name, belonging to the family [[Agavaceae]]. Chiefly [[Mexico|Mexican]], they occur also in the southern and western [[United States]] and in central and tropical [[South America]].  The plants have a large rosette of thick fleshy leaves generally ending in a sharp point and with a spiny margin; the stout stem is usually short, the leaves apparently springing from the root.

Each rosette is [[monocarpic]] and grows slowly to flower but once after a number of years, when a tall stem or &quot;mast&quot; grows from the center of the leaf rosette and bears a large number of shortly tubular flowers.  After development of fruit the original plant dies, but suckers are frequently produced from the base of the stem which become new plants.

[[Image:Agaveattenuata1web.jpg|thumb|left|Swan's Neck Agave (''Agave attenuata'')]]
The most familiar species is ''[[Agave americana]]'', a native of tropical America, the so-called [[century plant|Century Plant]] or American [[aloe]] (the [[maguey]] of Mexico). The name refers to the long time the plant takes to flower, although the number of years before flowering occurs depends on the vigor of the individual, the richness of the soil and the climate; during these years the plant is storing in its fleshy leaves the nourishment required for the effort of flowering. During the development of the inflorescence there is a rush of sap to the base of the young flowerstalk. In the case of ''A. americana'' and other species this is used by the Mexicans to make their national beverage, [[pulque]]; the flower shoot is cut out and the sap collected and subsequently fermented. By distillation a spirit called [[mezcal]] is prepared. The leaves of several species yield fiber, as for instance, ''Agave rigida var. sisalana'', [[sisal]] hemp, ''Agave decipiens'', False Sisal Hemp; ''Agave americana'' is the source of pita fiber, and is used as a fiber plant in Mexico, the [[West Indies]] and southern [[Europe]]. The flowering stem of the last named, dried and cut in slices, forms natural razor strops, and the expressed juice of the leaves will lather in water like soap. The Native Americans of Mexico used the agave both to make pens, nails and needles as well as string to sew and make weavings. In [[India]] the plant is extensively used for hedges along railroads.

[[Image:Aloe-flower.jpg|thumb|Agave in bloom in a garden (Roquevaire, Bouches-du-Rhône, France, September 1978)]]

''Agave americana'', century plant, was introduced into Europe about the middle of the [[16th century]] and is now widely cultivated for its handsome appearance; in the variegated forms the leaf has a white or yellow marginal or central stripe from base to apex. As the leaves unfold from the center of the rosette the impression of the marginal spines is very conspicuous on the still erect younger leaves. The tequ plants are usually grown in tubs and put out in the summer months, but in the winter require protection from frost. They mature very slowly and die after flowering, but are easily propagated by the offsets from the base of the stem.

Agave [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] has been used as an alternative to [[sugar]] in cooking.

The juice from many species of agave can cause acute contact [[dermatitis]].  It will produce reddening and blistering lasting one to two weeks.  Episodes of itching may recur up to a year thereafter, even though there is no longer a visible rash.  Interestingly, dried parts of the plants can be handled with bare hands with little or no effect.

==Taxonomy==
Agaves were once classified in [[Liliaceae]] but most references now include them in their own family, [[Agavaceae]].

Agaves have long presented special difficulties for [[taxonomy]]; variations within a species may be considerable, and a number of named species are of unknown origin, and may just be variants of original wild species. 

Spanish and Portuguese explorers probably brought agaves back with them, but really became popular in Europe during the [[19th century]], with many types being imported by collectors. Some of have been continuously propagated by offset since then, and do not consistently resemble any species known in nature, although this may simply be due to the unnatural growing conditions in Europe.

'''Asia''' is the largest and most populous region or [[continent]] depending on the definition.  It is traditionally defined as part of the [[landmass]] of [[Africa]]-[[Eurasia]] lying east of the [[Suez Canal]], east of the [[Ural Mountains]], and south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s. About 60% of the world's [[human population]] lives in Asia, of whom only 2% live in the northern and interior half ([[Siberia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Xinjiang]], [[Tibet]], [[Qinghai]], western [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]]); the other 98% live in the remaining half.
[[Image:LocationAsia.png|thumb|250px|World map showing Asia.]]
==Etymology==
The word ''Asia'' entered English, via [[Latin]], from [[Ancient Greek]] Ασία (''Asia''; see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]). This name is first attested in [[Herodotus]] (c. 440 BC), where it refers to [[Asia Minor]]; or, for the purposes of describing the [[Persian Wars]], to the [[Persian Empire]], as opposed to [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]]. Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three different women's names are used to describe a single land-mass ([[Europa]], Asia and [[Libya]], referring to Africa) stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of [[Prometheus]] but that the [[Lydians]] say it was named after [[Asias]], son of [[Cotys]] who passed the name on to a tribe in [[Sardis]]. 

Even before Herodotus, [[Homer]] knew of a [[Troy|Trojan]] ally named [[Asios Hyrtakides|Asios]], son of [[Hyrtacus]], a ruler over several towns, and elsewhere he describes a marsh as ασιος (Iliad 2, 461). The Greek term may be derived from [[Assuwa]], a [[14th century BC]] confederation of states in Western Anatolia. [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''assu-'' &quot;good&quot; is probably an element in that name. 

Alternatively, the ultimate etymology of the term may be from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''(w)aṣû(m)'', cognate of Hebrew יצא, which means &quot;to go out&quot; or &quot;to ascend&quot;, referring to the direction of the [[sun]] at sunrise in the [[Middle East]], and also likely connected with the Phoenician word ''asa'' meaning east. This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for ''Europe'', as being from [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] ''erēbu'' &quot;to enter&quot; or &quot;set&quot; (of the sun). However, an originally Mesopotamian or Middle Eastern perspective would not explain how the term &quot;Asia&quot; first came to be associated with Anatolia as lying ''west'' of the Semitic speaking area.

==Definition and Boundaries==
[[Image:Asia-map.png|right|thumb|280px|Political map of Asia]]
Medieval Europeans considered Asia as a continent, a distinct landmass. The European concept of the three continents in the [[Old World]] goes back to [[classical antiquity]] with the [[etymology]] of the word rooted in the ancient [[Near East|Near]] and [[Middle East]]. The demarcation between Asia and [[Africa]] is the [[Isthmus]] of [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and the [[Red Sea]]. The boundary between Asia and [[Europe]] is commonly believed to run through the [[Dardanelles]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], the [[Bosporus]], the Black Sea, the Caucasus Mountains, the Caspian Sea, the [[Ural River]] to its source, and the Ural Mountains to the [[Kara Sea]] near Kara, [[Russia]]. However, modern discovery of the extent of Africa and Asia made this definition rather anachronistic, especially in the case of Asia, which would have several regions that would be considered distinct landmasses if these criteria were used (for example, South Asia and East Asia). 

Geologists and physical geographers no longer consider Asia and Europe to be separate continents. It is either defined in terms of geological landmasses (physical geography) or tectonic plates (geology). In the former case, Europe is a western peninsula of [[Eurasia]] or the Africa-Eurasia landmass. In the latter, Europe and Asia are still part of the Eurasian plate, which excludes the Arabian and Indian tectonic plates. 

In human geography, there are two schools of thought. One school follows historical convention and treats Europe and Asia as different continents, categorizing Europe, East Asia (the Orient), South Asia (British India), and the Middle East (Arabia and Persia) as specific regions for more detailed analysis. The other schools equate the word &quot;continent&quot; in terms of geographical region when referring to Europe, and use the term &quot;region&quot; to describe Asia in terms of physical geography. Because in linguistic terms, &quot;continent&quot; implies a distinct landmass, it is becoming increasingly common to substitute the term &quot;region&quot; for &quot;continent&quot; to avoid the problem of disambiguation altogether.

There is much confusion in European languages with the term &quot;Asian&quot;. Because a category implies homogenity, the term &quot;Asian&quot; almost always refers to a subcategory of people from Asia rather than referring to &quot;Asian&quot; defined in term of &quot;Asia&quot;. The fact that in American English, Asian refers to East Asian (Orientals), while in British English, Asian refers to South Asian reflects this confusion. Sometimes, it is not even clear exactly what &quot;Asia&quot; consists of. Some definitions exclude [[Turkey]], the Middle East, and/or Russia. The term is sometimes used more strictly in reference to [[Asia Pacific]], which does not include the Middle East or Russia, but does include islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]] &amp;mdash; a number of which may also be considered part of [[Australasia]] and/or [[Oceania]]. Asia contains the [[Indian subcontinent]], Arabian subcontinent, as well as a piece of the North American plate in Siberia.

==Geographical regions==
{{seealso|Geography of Asia}}
[[Image:Asia satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|280px|Satellite view of Asia]]
As already mentioned, Asia is a subregion of [[Eurasia]]. For further subdivisions based on that term, see [[North Eurasia]] and [[Central Eurasia]].

Some Asian countries stretch beyond Asia. See [[Bicontinental country]] for details about the borderline cases between Asia and Europe, Asia and Africa, and Asia and Oceania.

The following subregions of Asia are traditionally recognized:
*[[Central Asia]]
*[[East Asia]]
*[[Far East]]
*[[North Asia]]
*[[South Asia]] (or Indian Subcontinent)
*[[Southeast Asia]]
*[[Southwest Asia]] (or Middle East or West Asia)

===Central Asia===
There is no absolute consensus in the usage of this term. Usually, Central Asia includes:
* the [[Central Asian Republics]] of [[Kazakhstan]] (excluding its small [[Bicontinental country#Countries in both Asia and Europe|European]] territory), [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].
* [[Afghanistan]], [[Mongolia]], and the western regions of [[China]] are also sometimes included.
* Former [[Soviet]] states in the [[Caucasus]] region.

Central Asia is currently geopolitically important because international disputes and conflicts over [[oil pipeline|oil pipelines]],  [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], and [[Chechnya]], as well as the presence of [[U.S. military]] and [[Military of the UK|U.K. military]] forces in [[Afghanistan]].

===East Asia ===
This area includes:
* The [[Pacific Ocean]] island countries of [[Taiwan]] and [[Japan]]. {{further|[[Political status of Taiwan]]}}
* [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]] on the [[Korean Peninsula]].
* [[China]], but sometimes only the eastern regions

Sometimes the nations of [[Mongolia]] and [[Vietnam]] are also included in East Asia.

More informally, [[Southeast Asia]] is included in East Asia on some occasions.

===North Asia===
This term is rarely used by geographers, but usually it refers to the bigger Asian part of Russia, also known as [[Siberia]]. Sometimes the northern parts of other Asian nations, such as [[Kazakhstan]] are also included in Northern Asia.

===South Asia (or Indian Subcontinent)===
South Asia is also referred to as the [[Indian Subcontinent]]. It includes:
* The [[Himalayan States]] of [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Bangladesh]].
* The [[Indian Ocean]] nations of [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[Maldives]]. India's [[Andaman]], [[Nicobar]] and [[Lakshadweep]] islands also lie in the Indian Ocean.
* The [[peninsular India]] (also known as the [[Deccan Plateau]])
* Sometimes Afghanistan is also included into this category.

===Southeast Asia===
This region contains the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Indochina]] and islands in the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]. The countries it contains are:

* In [[Indochina|mainland Southeast Asia]], the countries [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]].

* In [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], the countries of [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]] and [[Indonesia]] ([[Bicontinental country#Countries in both Asia and Oceania|some]] of the Indonesian islands also lie in the [[Melanesia]] region of [[Oceania]]). [[East Timor]] (also [[Melanesia]]n) is sometimes included too.

The country of [[Malaysia]] is divided in two by the [[South China Sea]], and thus has both a mainland and island part.

===Southwest Asia (or Middle East, Near East or West Asia)===
This can also be called by the Western term ''[[Middle East]]'', which is commonly used by Europeans and Americans. ''Middle East'' (to some interpretations) is often used to also refer to some countries in [[North Africa]]. Southwest Asia can be further divided into:

* [[Anatolia]] (i.e. [[Asia Minor]]), constituting the [[Asian]] [[Bicontinental country#Countries in both Asia and Europe|part of]] Turkey.
* The [[island nation]] of [[Cyprus]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].
* The [[Levant]] or [[Near East]], which includes [[Syria]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Iraq]] and the Asian [[Bicontinental country#Countries in both Asia and Africa|portion]] of [[Egypt]].
* The [[Arabian peninsula]], including [[Saudi Arabia]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], [[Oman]], [[Yemen]] and [[Kuwait]].
* The [[Caucasus]] region (which straddles both Asia and [[Europe]]), namely [[Transcaucasia]], including a small portion of Russia and, arguably, most if not all of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], and [[Azerbaijan]].
* The [[Iranian Plateau]], containing [[Iran]] and parts of other neighbouring nations.

{{main|Economy of Asia}}
In terms of [[gross domestic product]] ([[Purchasing Power Parity|PPP]]), the largest national economy within Asia is that of the [[PRC]] ([[People's Republic of China]]).  Over the last decade, China's and [[India]]'s economies have been growing rapidly, both with an average annual growth rate above 7%.  PRC is the world's second largest economy after the US, followed by [[Japan]] and [[India]] as the world's third and fourth largest economies respectively (then followed by the European nations: [[Germany]], [[U.K.]], [[France]] and [[Italy]]).

In terms of [[exchange rates]] (nominal GDP) however, Japan has the largest economy in Asia and second largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the Soviet Union (measured in [[Net Material Product]]) in 1986 and Germany in 1968.  (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the [[EU]], [[NAFTA]] or [[APEC]]).  Economic growth in Asia since [[World War II]] to the 1990's had been concentrated in few countries of the [[Pacific Rim]], and has spread more recently to other regions.  In the late 80's and early 90's Japan's economy was almost as large as that of the rest of the continent combined.  In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equalled the USA to tie the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 [[yen]].  However, since then Japan's currency has corrected and China has grown to be the second largest Asian economy, followed by India in terms of exchange rates.  It is expected that China will surpass Japan in currency terms to have the largest nominal GDP in Asia within a decade or two.

===Natural resources===
Asia is by a considerable margin the largest continent in the [[world]], and is rich in natural resources, such as [[Petroleum]] and [[iron]].

High productivity in agriculture, especially of [[rice]], allows high population density of countries in the warm and humid area.  Other main agricultural products include [[wheat]] and [[chicken]].

Forestry is extensive throughout Asia except Southwest and Central Asia. [[Fishing]] is a major source of food in Asia, particularly in Japan.

===Manufacturing===
Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in [[PRC]], [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Singapore]]. The industry varies from manufacturing cheap goods such as [[toy]]s to high-tech goods such as [[computer]]s and [[automobile|car]]s.  Many companies from [[Europe]], [[North America]], and [[Japan]] have significant operations in the developing Asia to take avantage of its abundant supply of cheap labor.

One of the major employers in manufacturing in Asia is the [[textile]] industry. Much of the world's supply of clothing and footwear now originates in Southeast Asia.

===Financial and other services===
Asia has three main financial centers. They are in [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]] and [[Tokyo]]. Call centers are becoming major employers in [[India]] and the [[Philippines]], due to the availablity of many well-educated English speakers. The rise of the business process [[outsourcing]] industry has seen the rise of India and China as the other financial centers.

==Early history==
{{main|History of Asia}}
[[Image:Asia 1892 amer ency brit.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of Asia, 1892.]]
The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions &amp;mdashl [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], and the [[Middle East]] &amp;mdash; linked by the interior mass of the [[Central Asia]]n [[steppe]].

The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys.  The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley]], and the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] shared many similarities, and may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the wheel.  Other innovations, such as that of writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area.  Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.

The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads, and from the steppes they could reach all areas of Asia.  The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the [[Indo-European]]s, who spread their languages into the Middle East, India, and in the [[Tocharians]], to the borders of China. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of [[Siberia]], was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, the climate, and the [[tundra]].  These areas remained very sparsely populated.

The centre and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts.  The [[Caucasus]] and [[Himalaya]] mountains and the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]] and [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty.  While technologically and socially, the urban city dwellers were more advanced, in many cases they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe.  However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force;  for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.

==Population density==
The following table lists countries and dependencies by [[population density]] in inhabitants and km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Unlike the figures in the country articles, the figures in this table are based on areas including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers) and may therefore be lower here.

The whole of Egypt, Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkey are referred to in the table, although they may be considered to be only [[Countries in both Europe and Asia|partly in Asia]]. Asia also contains about 60% of the world's population. Leaving the other 40% of the world's population to other continents.

'''Aruba''' is an [[island]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], just a short distance north of the [[Venezuela]]n [[Paraguaná Peninsula]], and it forms a part of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Unlike much of the Caribbean region, it has a dry climate and an arid, cactus-strewn landscape.  This climate has helped tourism, however, as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather. 
 
==History==
:''Main article: [[History of Aruba]]''

Discovered and claimed for [[Spain]] in 1499, Aruba was acquired by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in 1636. The island's economy has been dominated by three main industries. A [[19th century|19th-century]] [[gold]] rush was followed by prosperity brought on by the opening in 1924 of an [[Petroleum|oil]] refinery. The last decades of the [[20th century]] saw a boom in the [[tourism]] industry. 

Aruba seceded from the [[Netherlands Antilles]] on [[January 1]], [[1986]], and became a separate, self-governing member of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].  Movement toward full independence by [[1996]] was halted at Aruba's request in 1990.

==Politics==
:''Main article: [[Politics of Aruba]]''

Aruba is a part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, but maintains full control over its own affairs except for issues dealing with national defence, citizenship, foreign affairs, and extradition. Aruba has its own laws, constitution, government, and currency.

The Aruban [[head of state]] is the ruling monarch of the [[Netherlands]], who is represented in Aruba by a [[governor]], appointed for a six-year term. The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister]], who forms, together with the Council of Ministers, the [[executive branch]] of the government. 

They are elected by the [[parliament]], the [[unicameral]] Legislature or ''Staten'', which holds 21 seats. Members are elected by direct, popular vote to serve four-year terms.

==Geography==
:''Main article: [[Geography of Aruba]]''

Aruba is a generally flat, [[river]]less island renowned for its white sand [[beach]]es. Most of these are located on the western and southern coasts of the island, which are relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents.  The northern and eastern coasts, lacking this protection, are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched by humans.  The interior of the island features some rolling hills, the better two of which are called [[Hooiberg]] at 165 [[metre]]s (541 [[foot (unit of length|ft]]) and [[Mount Jamanota]], which is the highest on the island, at 188 metres (617 ft) above [[sea level]]. Oranjestad, the capital, is located at {{coor dm|12|19|N|70|1|W|}}.

As a separate member state of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], the island/state has no administrative subdivisions. On the east are [[Curaçao]] and [[Bonaire]],two island territories which form the southwest part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]; Aruba and these two Netherlands Antilles islands are also known as the [[ABC islands]].

The local [[climate]] is a pleasant tropical marine climate. Little seasonal temperature variation exists, which helps Aruba to attract tourists all year round. Temperatures are almost constant at about 28&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] (82&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]]), moderated by constant [[trade wind]]s from the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  Yearly precipitation barely reaches 500 [[millimeter|mm]] (20 [[inch|in]]), most of it falling in late autumn.  [[Image:Aruba_map.png|right|Map of Aruba with cities]]

==Economy==
:''Main article: [[Economy of Aruba]]''

Aruba enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean region, with low poverty and unemployment rates.  About half of the Aruban [[Gross National Product]] is earned with [[tourism]] or related activities. Most of the tourists are from [[Canada]], the [[European Union]] and other places notably the [[United States]], which is the country's largest trading partner. Oil processing is the dominant industry in Aruba, despite expansion of the tourism sector. The size of the agriculture and manufacturing industries remains minimal.

Deficit spending has been a staple in Aruba's history, and modestly high inflation has been present as well, although recent efforts at tightening monetary policy may correct this. Aruba receives some [[development aid]] from the Dutch government each year. The Aruban guilder has a fixed exchange rate with the [[United States dollar]] of 1.79:1.

==Demographics==
[[Image:Aruba-demography.png|thumb|300px|left|Population of Aruba, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
Having poor [[soil]] and aridity, Aruba was saved from plantation economics and the [[slave trade]].  In 1515, the Spanish transported the entire population to [[Hispaniola]] to work in the [[copper]] [[mining|mines]]; most were allowed to return when the mines were tapped out. The Dutch, who took control a century later, left the [[Arawaks]] to graze livestock, using the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean. The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands. No full-blooded [[Native American (Americas)|Indians]] remain, but the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic heritage. The majority of the population is descended from Arawak, Dutch and Spanish ancestors.  Recently there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring Latin American and Caribbean nations, attracted by the lure of well-paying jobs.

The two official languages are the Dutch language and the predominant, national language [[Papiamento]], which is classified as a Creole language. This [[creole language]] is formed primarily from 16th century [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and several other languages. Spanish and English are also spoken.  Islanders can often speak four or more languages and are mostly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].

==Culture==
:''Main article: [[Culture of Aruba]]''

The origins of the population and location of the island give Aruba a mixed culture. Dutch influence can still be seen, even though not much of the population is of Dutch origin. Tourism from the United States has recently also increased the visibility of American culture on the island. [[Queen Beatrix International Airport]], located near [[Oranjestad, Aruba]], currently serves the whole island of Aruba. This airport has access to various cities across the eastern U.S., from Miami, Orlando, Houston, Atlanta to New York. It also connects Aruba with Europe through the [[Schiphol Airport]] in the Netherlands.

The holiday of [[Carnival]] is an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries.  Carnival is usually held from the beginning of January until the end of February, with a large parade on the final Sunday of the festivities.

==Language==
{{main|Languages of Aruba}}
Language can be seen as an important part of island culture in Aruba. The cultural mixture has given way to a linguistic mixture known as &quot;[[Papiamento]]&quot;. However, islanders are known to speak many languages. Islanders often speak Papiamento, English, Dutch and Spanish. In recent years the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of its native language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Articles page1.jpg|thumb|right|The Articles of Confederation]] 
The '''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union''', commonly known as the '''Articles of Confederation''' was the first governing document of the [[United States|United States of America]]. 

The articles, which combined the [[13 colonies]] of the [[American Revolutionary War]] into a loose [[confederation]], were adopted by the [[Second Continental Congress]] on [[November 15]], [[1777]], after 16 months of debate. The articles were ratified three years later on March 1, 1781. 

The articles were eventually replaced by the [[United States Constitution]] on June 21, 1788, when the ninth state, [[New Hampshire]], ratified the Constitution. According to their own terms for modification, however, the articles were still in effect until 1790, when every one of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution.

== Ratification ==
The Articles of Confederation were submitted to the states for ratification on [[November 17]] [[1777]], accompanied by a letter from Congress urging that the document

:''be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one general system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities, under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength, to maintain and defend our common liberties .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. '' {{ref|ratificationletter}}

The document only became effective as it was ratified by the states. This process dragged on for several years, stalled by an interstate quarrel over claims to uncolonized land in the west. [[Maryland]] was the last hold-out; it refused to ratify until [[Virginia]] and [[New York]] agreed to rescind their claims to lands in the [[Ohio River]] valley. All of the colonies rebelling against Britain ratified it by [[1781]].

Although Congress debated the Articles for over a year, it requested immediate action on the part of the states. On [[February 5]] [[1778]] [[South Carolina]] became the first state to ratify the Articles of Confederation. However, three and a half years passed before the final ratification by [[Maryland]] on [[March 1]] [[1781]].

==Article Summaries ==
{{ChartersOfFreedom}}
Even though the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution were established by much of the same people, they were still very different. The document contained 13 articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section.

#Establishes the name of the confederation as &quot;The United States of America&quot;
#Explains the rights possessed by any state, and the amount of power to which any state is entitled
#Establishes the United States as a league of states united &quot;...for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them...&quot;
#Establishes [[freedom of movement]]&amp;ndash;anyone can pass freely between states, excluding &quot;[[pauper]]s, [[vagabond]]s, and [[fugitive]]s from justice excepted.&quot; All people are entitled to the rights established by the state into which he or she travels. If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state, he will be [[extradition|extradited]] to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed.
#Allocates one vote in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] (United States in Congress Assembled) to each state, which was entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members. Members of Congress were appointed by state legislatures; individuals could not serve more than three out of any six years.
#Limits the powers of states to conduct [[foreign relations]] and to [[declaration of war|declare war]].
#When an army is raised for common defense, [[Colonel (United States)|colonels]] and [[military rank]]s below colonel will be named by the state legislatures.
#Expenditures by the United States will be paid by funds raised by state legislatures, and apportioned to the states based on the real property values of each.
#Defines the rights of the central government: to declare war, to set weights and measures (including coins), and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states.
#Defines a [[Committee of the States]] to be a government when Congress is not in session.
#Requires nine states to approve the admission of a new state into the confederacy; preapproves [[Canada]], if they apply for membership.
#Reaffirms that the Confederation accepts war debt incurred by Congress before the articles ([[assumption]]).
#Declares that the articles are perpetual, and can only be altered by approval of Congress with ratification by ''all'' the state legislatures.

Still at war with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the colonists were reluctant to establish another powerful national government. Jealously guarding their new independence, the Continental Congress created a loosely structured [[unicameral]] legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states at the expense of the confederation. While calling on Congress to regulate military and monetary affairs, for example, the Articles of Confederation provided no mechanism to ensure states complied with requests for troops or revenue. At times this left the military in a precarious position, as [[George Washington]] wrote in a [[1781]] letter to the governor of [[Massachusetts]], [[John Hancock]].

== The end of the war ==
The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], ending hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for months because state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature. Yet, Congress had no power to enforce attendance. Writing to [[George Clinton (politician)|George Clinton]] in September [[1783]], George Washington complained:

:''Congress have come to no determination yet respecting the Peace Establishment, nor am I able to say when they will. I have lately had a conference with a Committee on this subject, and have reiterated my former opinions, but it appears to me that there is not a sufficient representation to discuss Great National points.'' {{ref|washingtonclinton}}

==Function==
The Articles supported the Congressional direction of the [[Continental Army]], and allowed the [[13 Colonies|Thirteen Colonies]] to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers. But as an instrument of government, they were largely a failure. Congress could make decisions, but had no power to enforce them.

Perhaps the most important power that Congress was denied was the power of taxation: Congress could only request [[money]] from the states. Understandably, the states did not generally comply with the requests in full, leaving the confederation chronically short of funds. The states and the national congress had both incurred debts during the war, and paying congressional debts became a major issue.

Nevertheless the [[Continental Congress]] did take two actions with lasting impact. The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established the general land survey and ownership provisions used throughout later American expansion. The [[Northwest Ordinance]] of [[1787]] noted the agreement of the original states to give up western land claims and cleared the way for the entry of new states.

Once the unity demanded by the Revolutionary War became unnecessary, the [[Continental Army]] was largely disbanded. A very small national force was maintained to man frontier forts and protect against Indian attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, [[George Washington|Washington]] defused the [[Newburgh conspiracy]], but riots by unpaid [[Pennsylvania]] veterans forced the Congress to leave [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] on [[June 21]].

==Revision==
In May [[1786]], [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]] of [[South Carolina]] proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting [[Congress]] power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus.

In September, five states assembled in the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)]] to discuss adjustments that would improve commerce. Under their chairman, [[Alexander Hamilton]], they invited state representatives to convene in [[Philadelphia]] to discuss improvements to the federal government. After debate, Congress endorsed the plan to revise the Articles of Confederation on [[February 21]] [[1787]]. According to some historians, the Articles were flawed; in particular, the [[confederal]] government was unable to settle state disputes on issues like trade and had no power to tax directly. After all, the states were thirteen individual [[republics]]. It took radical action to strip them of that [[sovereignty]].

==Lessons==
Although ultimately replaced by the [[United States Constitution]], the Articles of Confederation provided stability during the [[American Revolutionary War]] years. Most importantly, the experience of drafting and living under this initial document provided valuable lessons in self-governance and somewhat tempered fears about a powerful central government. Still, reconciling the turmoil between state and federal authority continues to challenge America, as seen in such conflicts as the [[1832]] [[Nullification Crisis]], the [[American Civil War]] ([[1861]]-[[1865|65]]), post-Civil War [[Reconstruction]], and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s landmark ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision in [[1954]].

==Signatures==
The copy of the Articles in the U.S. National Archives has a series of signatures on page six. A list of them is presented here. The signing of the Articles was a process that has caused some confusion. The Articles were approved for distribution to the states, on [[November 15]], [[1777]]. A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the [[Continental Congress|Congress]]. The copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and a cover letter had only the signatures of [[Henry Laurens]] and [[Charles Thomson]], who were the [[President of the Continental Congress|President]] and Secretary to the Congress.

But, the Articles at that time were unsigned, and the date was blank. Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the Articles on [[June 27]], [[1778]]. They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.

Then, on [[July 9]], [[1778]] the prepared copy was ready. They dated it, and began to sign. They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed. On that date, delegates present from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and South Carolina signed the articles to indicate that their states had ratified. New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland could not, since their states had not ratified. North Carolina and Georgia also didn't sign that day, since their delegations were absent.

After the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended. For example John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on [[August 8]]. John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on [[July 10]]), and the delegation signed the Articles on [[July 21]], [[1778]].

The other states had to wait until they ratified the Articles, and notified their Congressional delegation. Georgia signed on [[July 24]], New Jersey on [[November 26]], and Delaware on [[February 12]], [[1779]]. After a wait of two years, Maryland ratified, and her delegates signed the Articles on [[March 1]], [[1781]]. The articles were finally in force.

Congress had debated the Articles for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years. Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived. The '''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union''' were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time.

The signers and the states they represented were:
* [[New Hampshire]]: [[Josiah Bartlett]] and [[John Wentworth Jr.]]
* [[Massachusetts|Massachusetts Bay]]: [[John Hancock]], [[Samuel Adams]], [[Elbridge Gerry]], [[Francis Dana]], [[James Lovell (delegate)|James Lovell]], and [[Samuel Holten]]
* [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]: [[William Ellery]], [[Henry Marchant]], and [[John Collins (delegate)|John Collins]]
* [[Connecticut]]: [[Roger Sherman]], [[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]], [[Oliver Wolcott]], [[Titus Hosmer]], and [[Andrew Adams]]
* [[New York]]: [[James Duane]], [[Francis Lewis]], [[William Duer (1747-1799)|William Duer]], and [[Gouverneur Morris]]
* [[New Jersey]]: [[John Witherspoon]] and [[Nathaniel Scudder]]
* [[Pennsylvania]]: [[Robert Morris (merchant)|Robert Morris]], [[Daniel Roberdeau]], [[Jonathan Bayard Smith]], [[William Clingan]], and [[Joseph Reed (jurist)|Joseph Reed]]
* [[Delaware]]: [[Thomas McKean]], [[John Dickinson (1732-1808)|John Dickinson]], and [[Nicholas Van Dyke (1738-1789)|Nicholas Van Dyke]]
* [[Maryland]]: [[John Hanson]] and [[Daniel Carroll]]
* [[Virginia]]: [[Richard Henry Lee]], [[John Banister]], [[Thomas Adams (politician)|Thomas Adams]], [[John Harvie]], and [[Francis Lightfoot Lee]]
* [[North Carolina]]: [[John Penn (delegate)|John Penn]], [[Cornelius Harnett]], and [[John Williams (delegate)|John Williams]]
* [[South Carolina]]: [[Henry Laurens]], [[William Henry Drayton|Will Henry Drayton]], [[John Mathews]], [[Richard Hutson]], and  [[Thomas Heyward Jr.]]
* [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]: [[John Walton (1738-1783)|John Walton]], [[Edward Telfair]], and [[Edward Langworthy]]

==Presidents of the Congress of the Confederation==
The following list are those who led the [[Congress]] under the Articles of Confederation as the [[President of the United States in Congress Assembled|Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled]]. The &quot;president&quot; under the Articles was the presiding officer of Congress, not the chief [[executive (government)|executive]], as is the [[President of the United States]] under the Constitution. Also, the Articles defined the powers of a [[confederation]] of states as opposed to the current [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], which defines the powers of a [[federation]] of states.

'''Adam Sedgwick''' ([[March 22]], [[1785]] &amp;ndash; [[January 27]], [[1873]]) was one of the founders of modern [[geology]].  He proposed the [[Devonian period]] of the geological timescale and later the [[Cambrian]] period. The latter proposal was based on work which he did on [[Wales|Welsh]] rock strata.

Sedgwick was born in [[Dent (Lonsdale)|Dent]], at that time in [[Yorkshire]], the third child of an Anglican vicar. He was educated at [[Sedbergh School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].

==Introduction==

In [[1817]] he took [[holy orders]], and in [[1818]] he became [[Woodwardian Professor of Geology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] [[University of Cambridge Department of Earth Sciences|Department of Earth Sciences]], holding a chair that had been endowed ninety years before by the natural historian [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]]. He lacked formal training in geology, but he quickly became an active researcher in geology and [[paleontology]]. During his tenure, he immensely enlarged the geological collections of Cambridge University, and carried out important field research all over [[Great Britain]]. Sedgwick is said to have remarked, upon being appointed Woodwardian Professor, &quot;Hitherto I have never turned a stone; henceforth I will leave no stone unturned.&quot; In [[1822]] he carried out fieldwork unraveling the complex geology of the [[Lake District]] of [[northern England]], armed with the new discoveries and techniques of [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]]. He met and befriended the poet [[William Wordsworth]] on this expedition, and also met the poet [[Robert Southey]] and the chemist [[John Dalton]]. His lectures at [[Cambridge]] were immensely popular; he was a spellbinding [[lecturer]], and -- breaking with the traditions of his time -- his lectures were open to women, whom Sedgwick thought could make great contributions to natural history. He continued to rise in his profession: in [[1829]] he became President of the [[Geological Society of London]], and in [[1845]] a Vice-Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]. As Vice-Master, he led campaigns to open Cambridge to non-[[Anglican]]s and to reorganize the academic programs, in the process meeting and becoming close to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and her consort [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]]. By the 1850s he was in poor health, cared for by his niece Isabella. Still, he kept giving his famous lectures until [[1871]].

==Early work==

Sedgwick was one of several great figures in what has been called the Heroic Age of geology -- the time when the great geological time periods were defined, and when much exploration and fundamental research was carried out. Sedgwick's work placed him at the epicenter of one of the most heated geological controversies of his day, stemming from his work with the gentleman geologist [[Roderick Murchison]]. They explored the [[geology of Scotland]] in [[1827]], and in [[1839]] they jointly presented their researches on certain rocks in [[Devon]], [[England]], which had a distinctive [[fossil]] assemblage that led them to propose a new division of the geological time scale -- the [[Devonian]]. In the early 1830s, both men were working on the rocks of Wales, which were and are very difficult to work on due to extensive [[folding]] and [[geologic fault|faulting]]. However, they seemed to be older than most of the [[sedimentary rocks]] farther east. Murchison documented the presence of a distinctive set of fossils, one in which very few fish were found, but that included numerous different types of [[trilobites]], [[brachiopods]], and other such fossils. Murchison named the system of rocks containing such fossils the [[Silurian]], after the Silures, a Celtic tribe living in the Welsh Borderlands at the time of the Romans. Sedgwick, who had been working in central Wales, proposed the existence of a separate system below the Silurian, which he named the [[Cambrian]] -- after Cambria, the Latin name for Wales. The two presented a joint paper in [[1835]], entitled &quot;On the Silurian and Cambrian Systems, exhibiting the order in which the older sedimentary strata succeed each other in England and Wales.&quot; 

Sedgwick's upper &quot;Cambrian&quot; overlapped with the lower part of Murchison's &quot;Silurian.&quot; Sedgwick had defined his &quot;Cambrian&quot; using physical characters of the rocks, which were unique to Wales, and had not relied extensively on fossils, which could be found everywhere. Murchison, who had used fossils extensively in defining the Silurian, claimed at first that the upper Cambrian, and then the entire Cambrian, were really parts of the Silurian. The resulting quarrel between the two men left them permanently estranged and took years to resolve. There was more than a simple matter of names involved. Both geologists wanted the honour of describing the rocks that recorded the beginning of life on Earth, for no fossils were known that were older than those of the Cambrian. Murchison felt that the fossils of Sedgwick's &quot;Cambrian&quot; were not different enough from his &quot;Silurian&quot; forms to merit the naming of a geologic time period, and it was some time before truly distinctive Cambrian fossils were documented. Today, following the solution worked out in 1879 by Sedgwick's colleague [[Charles Lapworth]], geologists use both time periods, with a third one -- the [[Ordovician]], also named for a Celtic tribe in Wales -- between the Cambrian and the Silurian, equivalent to the disputed &quot;upper Cambrian-lower Silurian&quot; beds. Each one of these is now known to be characterized by distinct fossil assemblages.

==Disagreement with Darwin==

For one summer of his work in Wales which was to lead to this controversy, Sedgwick made a fateful choice of field assistant: a young Cambridge graduate named [[Charles Darwin]]. Darwin had passed his examinations for the [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in January 1831, and began attending Sedgwick's geology lectures, which he found fascinating. That summer, the two men explored the rocks of north Wales; Darwin got a &quot;crash course&quot; in field geology from Sedgwick, an experience that would stand him in good stead over the next five years, on the round-the-world voyage of [[HMS Beagle]]. During this voyage, Darwin sent rocks and fossils from [[South America]] back to Sedgwick, as well as descriptions of the geology of South America. These impressed Sedgwick, who wrote in a letter to Darwin's family: 

He is doing admirably in S. America &amp; has already sent home a Collection above all praise. -- It was the best thing in the world for him that he went out on the Voyage of Discovery... 
In November 1835, before Darwin had returned to England, Sedgwick read some of Darwin's work on South American geology to the Geological Society of London. This greatly improved Darwin's reputation as a scientist; he was inducted into the Society shortly after his return. The two stayed friends until Sedgwick's death, but Sedgwick was upset and disappointed by Darwin's theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. After reading [[The Origin of Species]], Sedgwick candidly wrote to Darwin on [[November 24]], [[1859]]: 

&quot;If I did not think you a good tempered &amp; truth loving man I should not tell you that. . . I have read your book with more pain than pleasure. Parts of it I admired greatly; parts I laughed at till my sides were almost sore; other parts I read with absolute sorrow; because I think them utterly false &amp; grievously mischievous-- You have deserted-- after a start in that tram-road of all solid physical truth-- the true method of induction. . . &quot;

However despite this difference of opinion, the two men remained friendly until Sedgwick's death.

==Flawed opinions==

Sedgwick's own geological views were generally catastrophic -- he believed that the history of the [[Earth]] had been marked by a series of cataclysmic events which had destroyed much of the Earth's life. In this belief he followed Cuvier, and he was opposed to Charles Lyell's models of slow, gradual geological change and a more or less steady-state Earth. However, Sedgwick was interested in the possibility that at least some of the &quot;catastrophic&quot; changes implied by the rock record might be shown to be gradual. He originally followed his colleague [[William Buckland]] in believing that the uppermost [[Pleistocene]] deposits had been laid down by the Biblical Flood, but retracted this belief after many of these deposits turned out to have been formed by glaciers, not floods. Sedgwick also did not object to evolution, or &quot;development&quot; as such theories were called then, in the broad sense -- to the fact that the life on Earth had changed over time. Nor was he a young-Earth creationist; he believed that the Earth must be extremely old. As Darwin wrote of Sedgwick's lectures, &quot;What a capital hand is Sedgewick [sic] for drawing large cheques upon the Bank of Time!&quot; 

However, Sedgwick believed in the Divine creation of life over long periods of time, by &quot;a power I cannot imitate or comprehend -- but in which I believe, by a legitimate conclusion of sound reason drawn from the laws of harmonies of nature.&quot; What Sedgwick objected to was the apparent amoral and materialist nature of Darwin's proposed mechanism, natural selection, which he thought degrading to humanity's spiritual aspirations. His letter of November 24 went on to state: 

This view of nature you have stated admirably; tho' admitted by all naturalists &amp; denied by no one of common sense. We all admit development as a fact of history; but how came it about? Here, in language, &amp; still more in logic, we are point blank at issue-- There is a moral or metaphysical part of nature as well as a physical. A man who denies this is deep in the mire of folly. Tis the crown &amp; glory of organic science that it does thro' final cause, link material to moral. . . You have ignored this link; &amp;, if I do not mistake your meaning, you have done your best in one or two pregnant cases to break it. Were it possible (which thank God it is not) to break it, humanity in my mind, would suffer a damage that might brutalize it--&amp; sink the human race into a lower grade of degradation than any into which it has fallen since its written records tell us of its history.

'''Arthur Koestler''' ([[September 5]], [[1905]], [[Budapest]] &amp;ndash; [[March 3]], [[1983]], [[London]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[polymath]] who became a naturalized [[United Kingdom|British]] subject. He wrote [[journalism]], [[novels]], social [[philosophy]], and books on scientific subjects. He was a [[Communism|Communist]] during much of the 1930s and remained politically active until the 1950s. He wrote a number of popular books, including ''Arrow in the Blue'' (the first volume of his autobiography), ''The Yogi and the Commissar'' (a collection of essays, many dealing with [[Communism]]), ''The Sleepwalkers'' (''A History of Man's Changing Vision of the Universe''), ''The Act of Creation'', and ''The Thirteenth Tribe'' giving a new theory of the origins of the Jews of Eastern Europe. His most famous work, the novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' about the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Great Purge|purges]] of the 1930s, ranks with [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' as a fictional treatment of [[Stalinism]]. He also wrote ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' articles.&lt;!--Many number?? I know but one.--&gt;

== Life ==
He was born Kösztler Artur (Hungarians put the [[surname]] first) in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] to a [[German language|German-speaking]] Hungarian family of [[Ashkenazi Jews| Ashkenazi Jewish]] descent. His father, Henrik, was an [[industrialist]] and [[inventor]] whose business ideas revealed flawed judgement; for example, he invested for a while in the manufacture of a kind of [[radioactive]] soap. When Artur was 14, his family moved to [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. In 1918, Hungary obtained its independence from Austria and flirted for a while with [[Bolshevism]].

Koestler studied [[science]] and [[psychology]] at the [[University of Vienna]], where he became involved in [[Zionism]]. After completing his studies, he worked as a [[news correspondent]]. From [[1926]] to [[1929]] he lived in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]], partly in a ''[[kibbutz]]''. He joined the [[Germany|German]] [[Communist Party]] in [[1931]], but left it after the [[Stalin]]ist purges of [[1938]]. During this period he traveled extensively in the [[Soviet Union]] and climbed [[Mount Ararat]] in [[Turkey]]. In [[Turkmenistan]], he met the black American writer [[Langston Hughes]]. In [[1931]], he was a member of a [[zeppelin]] expedition to the [[North Pole]].

In his memoir ''The Invisible Writing'', Koestler recalls that during the summer of [[1935]] he &quot;wrote about half of a satirical novel called ''[[The Good Soldier Švejk|The Good Soldier Schweik Goes to War Again....]]''. It had been commissioned by [[Willi Münzenberg|Willy Münzenberg]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;the [[Comintern]]'s chief [[propagandist]] in the [[Western world|West]]] ... but was vetoed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party]] on the grounds of the book's 'pacifist errors'...&quot; (p. 283).

Soon after the outbreak of [[World War II]], the French authorities detained him for several months in a camp for resident aliens at Le Vernet in the foothills of the [[Pyrenees]] mountains. Upon his release, he joined the [[French Foreign Legion]]. He eventually escaped to [[England]] via Morocco and Portugal. In England, he served in the [[British Army]] as a member of the [[British Pioneer Corps]], 1941-42, then worked for the [[BBC]]. He became a [[British subject]] in [[1945]]. He returned to France after the war, where he rubbed shoulders with the set gravitating around [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. One of the characters in de Beauvoir's novel ''The Mandarins'' is believed based on Koestler.

He returned to [[London]] and spent the rest of his life writing and lecturing. He was made a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the [[1970s]]. In [[1983]], Koestler, suffering from [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[leukemia]], committed joint [[suicide]] by taking an overdose of drugs with his third wife Cynthia. He had long been an advocate of voluntary [[euthanasia]], and in [[1981]], had become vice-president of &quot;[[EXIT]]&quot;, a British group campaigning for it. His will endowed the chair of [[parapsychology]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]].

===Multilingualism=== 
In addition to his mother tongue [[German language|German]], Koestler became fluent in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[English language|English]], and [[French language|French]], and knew some [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. His biographer [[David Cesarani]] claims there is some evidence that Koestler may have picked up some [[Yiddish]] from his grandfather. Koestler's multilingualism was principally due to his having resided, worked, and/or studied in [[Hungary]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]] (pre-independence [[Israel]]), the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]], all by 40 years of age.

Though he wrote the bulk of his later work in English, Koestler wrote his best-known novels in three different languages: ''The Gladiators'' in Hungarian, ''Darkness at Noon'' in German (although the original is now lost), and ''Arrival and Departure'' in English. His journalism was written in German, Hebrew, French and English. He claimed to have produced the first Hebrew language [[crossword]] puzzles.

===Women===
Koestler was married to Dorothy Asher (1935-50), Mamaine Paget (1950-52), and Cynthia Jefferies (1965-83). He also had a very short fling with the French writer [[Simone de Beauvoir]], one that may explain the mutual animosity between him and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. David Cesarani claimed that Koestler beat and raped several women, including [[film director]] [[Jill Craigie]]. The resulting protests led to the removal of a bust of Koestler from public display at the [[University of Edinburgh]].

Questions have also been raised by his [[suicide pact]] with his last spouse. Although he was [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] at the time, she was apparently healthy, leading some to claim he wrongly persuaded her to take her own life.

==Mixed legacy==
Just as ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' was selling well during the [[Cold War]] of the 40s and 50s, Koestler announced his retirement from [[politics]]. Much of what he wrote thereafter revealed a multidisciplinary thinker whose work anticipated a number of trends by many years. He was among the first to experiment with [[LSD]] (in a laboratory). He also wrote about [[Japan|Japanese]] and [[India|Indian]] mysticism in ''[[The Lotus and the Robot]]'' ([[1960]]). He did not merely arrive at different answers to accepted questions; rather, he tended to ask questions that no one else thought to ask.

This originality resulted in an uneven set of ideas and conclusions.  Some of them, such as his work on creativity (''Insight and Outlook, Act of Creation'') and the history of science (''The Sleepwalkers''), are arguably brilliant and challenge us to readjust our thinking. Some of his other pursuits, such as his interest in the [[paranormal]], his support for [[euthanasia]], his theory of the origin of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] like himself, and his disagreement with [[Darwinism]], are more controversial.

=== Politics ===
Koestler was involved in a number of political causes during his life, from [[Zionism]] and [[communism]] to [[anti-communism]], voluntary [[euthanasia]] and campaigns against [[capital punishment]], particularly [[hanging]]. He was also an early advocate of [[nuclear disarmament]].

=== Journalism ===
Until the bestseller status of ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' made him financially comfortable, Koestler often earned his living as a journalist and foreign correspondent, trading on his ability to write quickly in several languages, and to acquire with facility a working knowledge of a new language. He wrote for a variety of newspapers, including ''Vossische Zeitung'' (science editor) and ''B.Z. am Mittag'' (foreign editor) in the 1920s. In the early 1930s, he worked for the Ullstein publishing group in [[Berlin]] and did freelance writing for the French press. 

While covering the [[Spanish Civil War]], in [[1937]], he was captured and held for several months by the [[Falange|Falangists]] in [[Málaga]], until the [[United Kingdom|British]] Foreign Office negotiated his release. His ''[[Spanish Testament]]'' records these experiences, which he soon transformed into his classic prison novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]''. After his release from Spanish detention, Koestler worked for the ''News Chronicle'', then edited ''Die Zukunft'' with [[Willi Münzenberg]], an anti-Nazi, anti-Stalinist German language paper based in [[Paris]], founded in [[1938]]. During and after [[WWII]], he wrote for a number of English and American papers, including ''The Sunday Telegraph'', on various subjects.

===Science===
During the last 30 years of his life, Koestler wrote extensively on science and scientific practice. The [[Post-Modernism|post-modernist]] scepticism colouring much of this writing tended to alienate most of the scientific community. A case in point is his 1971 book ''The Case of the Midwife Toad'' about the biologist [[Paul Kammerer]], who claimed to find experimental support for [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian inheritance]].

[[Mysticism]] and a fascination with the [[paranormal]] imbued much of his later work, and greatly influenced his personal life. He left a substantial part of his estate to establish the Koestler Institute at the [[University of Edinburgh]] dedicated to the study of [[Parapsychology|paranormal]] phenomena. His ''The Roots of Coincidence'' centered on yet another line of unconventional research by Paul Kammerer, this time his claim of a quantum theory of coincidence or [[synchronicity]], a theory Koestler evaluated in light of the writings of [[Carl Jung]]. More controversial were Koestler's studies of [[levitation]] and [[telepathy]].

===Judaism===
Although a lifelong atheist, Koestler's ancestry was Jewish. His biographer [[David Cesarani]] has claimed that Koestler deliberately disowned his Jewish ancestry.

Koestler's book ''[[The Thirteenth Tribe]]'' advanced the controversial thesis that [[Ashkenazi]] Jews are not descended from the Israelites of antiquity, but from the [[Khazars]], a [[Turkic]] people in the [[Caucasus]] who converted to [[Judaism]] in the [[8th century]] and were later forced to move westwards into current [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]]. Koestler stated that part of his intent in writing ''The Thirteenth Tribe'' was to defuse [[anti-Semitism]] by undermining the identification of European Jews with Biblical Jews, with the hope of rendering anti-Semitic epithets such as &quot;Christ killer&quot; inapplicable. Ironically,  Koestler's thesis that Ashkenazi Jews are not Semitic has become an important claim of many anti-Semitic groups. Some [[Palestinian]]s have eagerly seized upon this thesis, believing that to identify most Jews as non-Semites seriously undermines their historical claim to the [[land of Israel]]. The thesis of ''The Thirteenth Tribe'' has since been criticized. To date, the genetic evidence has been inconclusive. Some researchers claim to find a Middle Eastern genetic element in virtually all Ashkenazim. Others note both Turkic words and Turkic genetic markers in these populations.  But the usefulness of genetic markers in determining ancestry can be problematic; for instance, Ashkenazim also display a high level of similarity to the genetic markers of [[Khoisan]] [[Bushmen]] in Southern Africa.  A thorough review of the scientific literature can be found at [http://www.khazaria.com/ Khazaria.com].

When Koestler resided in Palestine during the 1920s, he lived on a [[kibbutz]], an experience forming the basis of his unfinished ''Thieves in the Night''.  His view of [[Israel]] was that it would never be destroyed, short of a second [[Shoah]]. He supported the statehood of Israel, but opposed a diaspora Jewish culture. In an interview published in the ''London Jewish Chronicle'' around the time of Israel's founding, Koestler asserted that all Jews should either migrate to Israel, or assimilate completely into their local cultures. Koestler was also no dogmatic Zionist; for instance, he proposed that Israel drop the [[Hebrew alphabet]] for the [[Roman alphabet|Roman]].

== Cultural influence ==
In his younger days, the [[singer]] [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] was an avid reader of Koestler. His band of the time, [[The Police]] were to name one of their albums ''[[Ghost in the Machine]]'' after one of Koestler's books. The title ''[[Synchronicity (album)|Synchronicity]]'' was also inspired by Koestler's ''[[The Roots of Coincidence]]'', which mentions [[Carl Jung]]'s [[synchronicity|theory]] of the same name. Koestler knew little about the burgeoning [[New Wave music]] scene, and is alleged to have said:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Look at this. Did you ever see a magazine called the ''New Musical Express''? It turns out there is a pop group called [[The Police]] - I don't know why they are called that, presumably to distinguish them from the punks - and they've made an album of my essay ''The Ghost in the Machine''. I didn't know anything about it until my clipping agency sent me a review of the record. &lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The [[cyberpunk]] [[manga]] and [[anime]] series ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' was also inspired by Koestler's ''The Ghost in the Machine''.

{{Five oceans}}
The '''Atlantic Ocean''' is [[Earth]]'s second-largest [[ocean]], covering approximately one-fifth of its surface. The ocean's name, derived from [[Greek mythology]], means the &quot;[[Sea]] of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]&quot;.

This ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending in a north-south direction and is divided into the North Atlantic and South Atlantic by [[Equatorial Counter Current|equatorial counter current]]s at about 8° north [[latitude]]. Bounded by the [[Americas]] on the west and [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] on the east, the Atlantic is linked to the [[Pacific Ocean]] by the [[Arctic Ocean]] on the north and the [[Drake Passage]] on the south. An artificial connection between the Atlantic and Pacific is also provided by the [[Panama Canal]].  On the east, the dividing line between the Atlantic and the [[Indian Ocean]] is the 20° east meridian, running south from [[Cape Agulhas]] to [[Antarctica]].  The Atlantic is separated from the [[Arctic Ocean]] by a line from [[Greenland]] to northwestern [[Iceland]] and then from northeastern Iceland to southernmost tip of [[Spitsbergen]] and then to [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]] in northern [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ioc.unesco.org/oceanteacher/OceanTeacher2/01_GlobOcToday/03_GeopolOc/s23_1953.pdf ''Limits of Oceans and Seas''].  International Hydrographic Organization Special Publication No. 23, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ireland-AtlanticOceanwithAranIsland.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Atlantic Ocean as seen from the west coast of [[Ireland]] on a fair day.]]
Covering approximately 20% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic Ocean is second only to the Pacific in size. With its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about [[1 E14 m²|106,400,000]] [[square kilometre]]s (41,100,000 [[square mile]]s); without them, it has an area of [[1 E13 m²|82,400,000 square kilometres]] (31,800,000 sq mi). The land area that drains into the Atlantic is four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic Ocean with its adjacent seas is [[1 E15 m³|354,700,000]] [[cubic kilometre]]s (85,100,000 [[cubic mile|cu mi]]) and without them 323,600,000 cubic kilometres (77,640,000 cu mi).

The average depths of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is 3,332 [[metre]]s (10,932 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]); without them it is 3,926 metres (12,881 ft).  The greatest depth, 8,605 metres (28,232 ft), is in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]]. The width of the Atlantic varies from [[1 E6 m|2,848]] [[kilometre]]s (1,770 [[mile|miles]]) between Brazil and [[Liberia]] to about [[1 E6 m|4,830 kilometes]] (3,000 mi) between the United States and northern Africa.

The Atlantic Ocean has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs, and seas. These include the [[Caribbean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Black Sea]], [[North Sea]], [[Labrador Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]], and [[Norwegian Sea|Norwegian]]-[[Greenland Sea]]. Islands in the Atlantic Ocean include [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Rockall]], [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Fernando de Noronha]], the [[Azores]], the [[Madeira Islands]], the [[Canaries]], the [[Cape Verde]] Islands, [[Sao Tome e Principe]], [[Newfoundland]], [[Bermuda]], the [[West Indies]], [[Ascension Island|Ascension]], [[Saint Helena (Britain)|St. Helena]], [[Trindade Island|Trindade]], [[Martin Vaz]], [[Tristan da Cunha]], the [[Falkland Islands]], and [[South Georgia Island]].
[[Image:Atlantic_Ocean.png|right|Atlantic Ocean]]
==Ocean bottom==
The principal feature of the bottom [[topography]] of the Atlantic Ocean is a great submarine mountain range called the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]. It extends from [[Iceland]] in the north to approximately 58° south latitude, reaching a maximum width of about 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi). A great [[rift valley]] also extends along the ridge over most of its length. The depth of water over the ridge is less than 2,700 metres (8,900 ft) in most places, and several mountain peaks rise above the water, forming islands. The South Atlantic Ocean has an additional submarine ridge, the Walvis Ridge. 

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge separates the Atlantic Ocean into two large [[trough (geology)|trough]]s with depths averaging between 3,700 and 5,500 metres (12,000 and 18,000 ft). Transverse ridges running between the continents and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins. Some of the larger basins are the Guiana, North American, Cape Verde, and Canaries basins in the North Atlantic. The largest South Atlantic basins are the Angola, Cape, Argentina, and Brazil basins.

The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat, although numerous [[seamount]]s and some [[guyot]]s exist. Several deeps or trenches are also found on the ocean floor. The Puerto Rico Trench, in the North Atlantic, is the deepest. The [[Laurentian Abyss]] is found off the eastern coast of Canada. In the south Atlantic, the [[South Sandwich Trench]] reaches a depth of 8,428 metres (27,651 ft). A third major trench, the [[Romanche Trench]], is located near the equator and reaches a depth of about 7,454 metres (24,455 ft). The shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography. In addition, a number of deep channels cut across the continental rise.

Ocean [[sediment]]s are composed of terrigenous, pelagic, and authigenic material. Terrigenous deposits consist of sand, mud, and rock particles formed by erosion, weathering, and volcanic activity on land and then washed to sea. These materials are largely found on the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and are thickest off the mouths of large rivers or off desert coasts. Pelagic deposits, which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor, include red clays and [[Globigerinida|Globigerina]], [[pteropod]], and siliceous oozes. Covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from 60 metres to 3,300 metres (200 ft to 11,000 ft), they are thickest in the convergence belts and in the zones of upwelling. Authigenic deposits consist of such materials as [[manganese nodule]]s. They occur where [[sediment]]ation proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits.

==Water characteristics==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Capespearnew.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Atlantic Ocean at [[Cape Spear]], Newfoundland]] --&gt;
The [[salinity]] of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season. Although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator, in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north latitude. Surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation, precipitation, river inflow, and melting of sea ice.

Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from less than −2&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] to 29&amp;nbsp;°C (28&amp;nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]] to 84&amp;nbsp;°F). &lt;!-- less than 2 is not −2, but assuming less than -2 intended, degree signs butt to letter with space from number --&gt; Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7&amp;nbsp;°C to 8&amp;nbsp;°C (13&amp;nbsp;°F to 15&amp;nbsp;°F).

The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The North Atlantic deep water reaches depths of as much as 4,000 metres (13,200 ft). The [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] bottom water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres (13,200 ft).

Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the [[Sargasso Sea]], in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average.  The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of [[seaweed]], and is also the spawning ground for the [[European eel]].

Due to the [[Coriolis effect]], water in the North Atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction, whereas water circulation in the South Atlantic is counter clockwise. The South [[tide]]s in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-[[diel|diurnal]]; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. The tides are a general wave that moves from south to north. In latitudes above 40° north some east-west oscillation occurs.

==Climate==
[[Image:Atlantic hurricane graphic.gif|frame|right|Waves in the trade winds in the Atlantic Ocean — areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the prevailing wind — create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes.]]

The climate of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters. Because of the oceans' great capacity for retaining heat, maritime climates are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures. The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest climatic zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in the high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. Adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents. The [[Gulf Stream]], for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and northwestern Europe, and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of northeastern Canada (the [[Grand Banks]] area) and the northwestern coast of Africa. In general, winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas. [[tropical cyclone|Hurricane]]s develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.

==History and economy==
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the world's oceans, after the [[Southern Ocean]]. Evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to 180 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral supercontinent, [[Pangaea]], were being rafted apart by the process of seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores. The [[Vikings]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]], and [[Christopher Columbus]] were the most famous among its early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established. As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the Americas (known as [[transatlantic]] trade). Numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken, including those by the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont Geological Observatory, and the United States Navy [[Hydrographic office#United States|Hydrographic Office]].

The ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it. Besides its major &quot;[[transatlantic]]&quot; transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the [[sedimentary rock]]s of the continental shelves and the world's richest fishing resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major species of fish caught are [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[hake]], [[herring]], and [[mackerel]]. The most productive areas include the [[Grand Banks]] of [[Newfoundland]], the shelf area off [[Nova Scotia]], [[Georges Bank]] off [[Cape Cod]], the Bahama Banks, the waters around [[Iceland]], the [[Irish Sea]], the [[Dogger Bank]] of the [[North Sea]], and the Falkland Banks. [[Eel]], [[lobster]], and [[whale]]s have also been taken in great quantities. All these factors, taken together, tremendously enhance the Atlantic's great commercial value. Because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills, [[marine debris]], and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution.

*In [[1858]], the first [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]] was laid by [[Cyrus Field]].
*In [[1919]], the American [[NC-4]] became the first [[airplane]] to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands along the way).
*Later in [[1919]], a British airplane piloted by [[Alcock and Brown]] made the first non-stop transatlantic flight from [[Newfoundland]] to [[Ireland]].
*In [[1921]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an [[airship]].
*In [[1922]], the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first to cross the South Atlantic in an [[airship]].
*The first transatlantic [[telephone]] call was made on [[January 7]], 1927.
*In [[1927]], [[Charles Lindbergh]] made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between [[New York City]] and [[Paris]]). 
*After rowing for 81 days and 2,962 miles, on [[December 3]], [[1999]] [[Tori Murden]] became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by [[rowboat]] alone when she reached [[Guadeloupe]] from the [[Canary Islands]].

'''Area - comparative:'''
slightly less than 6.5 times the size of the [[United States]]

'''Coastline:'''
111,866 km (69,510 mi)

'''Climate:'''
Tropical cyclones ([[hurricane]]s) develop anywhere from off the coast of Africa near [[Cape Verde]] to the [[Windward Islands]] and move westward into the [[Caribbean Sea]] or up the east coast of North America; hurricanes can occur from May to December, but are most frequent from late July to early November. Storms are common in the North Atlantic during northern winters, making ocean crossings more difficult and dangerous.

==Terrain==
The surface is usually covered with sea ice in the [[Labrador Sea]], [[Denmark Strait]], and [[Baltic Sea]] from October to June. There is a clockwise warm-water gyre (broad, circular system of currents) in the northern Atlantic, and a counter-clockwise warm-water gyre in the southern Atlantic. The ocean floor is dominated by the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin, first discovered by the [[Challenger Expedition]].

===Elevation extremes===
*''lowest point:'' [[Milwaukee Deep]] in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]] -8,605 metres (28,232 ft; 5.3 mi)
*''highest point:'' sea level 0 metres

===Natural resources===
[[Petroleum]] and [[gas]] fields, [[fish]], marine mammals ([[seal (mammal)|seal]]s and [[whale]]s), sand and gravel aggregates, [[placer deposit]]s, polymetallic nodules, precious stones

===Natural hazards===
[[Iceberg]]s are common in the [[Davis Strait]], [[Denmark Strait]], and the northwestern Atlantic Ocean from February to August and have been spotted as far south as [[Bermuda]] and the [[Madeira Islands]]. Ships are subject to [[superstructure#Engineering concept|superstructure]] [[icing (nautical)|icing]] in extreme northern Atlantic from October to May. Persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September. So can hurricanes north of the equator (May to December).

The [[Bermuda Triangle]] is popularly believed to be the site of numerous aviation and shipping incidents, due to unexplained and supposedly mysterious causes, but coastguard records do not support this belief.

== Current environmental issues ==
Endangered marine species include the [[manatee]], [[seal (mammal)|seal]]s, [[sea lion]]s, [[turtle]]s, and [[whale]]s. Drift net fishing is killing [[dolphin]]s, [[albatross]]es and other seabirds ([[petrel]]s, [[auk]]s), hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to international disputes. There is municipal sludge pollution off the eastern United States, southern [[Brazil]], and eastern [[Argentina]], oil pollution in the [[Caribbean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Lake Maracaibo]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], and [[North Sea]], and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.

== Notes on geography ==
Major chokepoints include the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and the [[Panama Canal]]; strategic straits include the [[Strait of Dover]], [[Straits of Florida]], [[Mona Passage]], The Sound ([[Oresund]]), and [[Windward Passage]]; the [[Equator]] divides the Atlantic Ocean into the North Atlantic Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean (previously known as the [[Ethiopic Ocean]]). During the [[Cold War]] the so called [[Greenland]]-[[Iceland]]-[[United Kingdom|UK]] (GIUK) Gap was a major strategic concern, the seabed in that area was laid with extensive [[hydrophone]] systems to track Soviet [[submarine]]s.

'''Arthur Schopenhauer''' ([[February 22]], [[1788]] &amp;ndash; [[September 21]], [[1860]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]]. He is most famous for his work ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.  He is commonly known for having espoused a sort of philosophical [[pessimism]] that saw life as being essentially [[evil]], futile, and full of suffering. However, upon closer inspection, in accordance with [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern thought]], especially that of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], he saw [[salvation]], deliverance, or escape from suffering in [[aesthetic]] [[contemplation]], [[sympathy]] for others, and [[ascetic]] living.  His ideas profoundly influenced the fields of [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[music]], and [[literature]].

== Life ==
Schopenhauer was born in [[1788]] in [[Sztutowo]], Poland, near [[Gdańsk]]. He was the son of Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer and [[Johanna Schopenhauer]], a middle class mercantile family of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] heritage, although they had strong feelings against any kind of nationalism. Indeed, the name Arthur was selected by his father especially because it was the same in [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], and [[French language|French]]. His parents were both from the city, and Johanna was an author as well. After the city was annexed by [[Prussia]] during the second [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Poland]] in [[1793]], the Schopenhauer family fled to [[Hamburg]]; in [[1805]] Schopenhauer's father died, possibly by [[suicide]], and Johanna moved to [[Weimar]]. Because of a promise to pursue a business career, Schopenhauer remained in Hamburg. His disgust of this career, however, drove him away to join his mother in Weimar after only a year. He never got along with his mother; when the writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], who was a friend of Johanna Schopenhauer, told her that he thought her son was destined for great things, Johanna objected: she had never heard there could be ''two'' geniuses in a single family.

Schopenhauer studied at the [[Georg August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]] and was awarded a PhD from the [[University of Jena]].  In [[1820]], Schopenhauer became a lecturer at the [[University of Berlin]]; it was there that his opposition to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] began. 

While in Berlin, Schopenhauer became involved in a consuming lawsuit from a Caroline Marquet. She asked for damages from him, a man of independent means, on the basis that she had been injured when Schopenhauer allegedly pushed her. Marquet had noisily attracted Schopenhauer's attention. Then, Marquet's companion witnessed her as being prostrate outside of his apartment. Marquet claimed that the philosopher had assaulted and battered her after she refused to leave his doorway. In this manner, she succeeded in gaining, through the court, a portion of Schopenhauer's limited wealth; he had to make payments for many years. His reputation was permanently damaged by her legal machination.

Schopenhauer's health deteriorated during the year of [[1860]]. He died of [[natural causes]] on [[September 21]] of the same year at the age of 72. 

Schopenhauer called himself a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] and despised Hegel. He formulated a [[philosophical pessimism|pessimistic]] [[philosophy]] that gained importance and support after the failure of the German and Austrian [[revolution]]s of [[1848]].

== Philosophy ==
Schopenhauer's starting point was [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s division of the universe into [[phenomenon]] and [[noumenon]], claiming that the noumenon was the same as that in us which we call [[will (philosophy)|Will]]. It is the inner content and the driving force of the world. For Schopenhauer, human will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]; in other words, desire is understood to be prior to thought, and, in a parallel sense, will is said to be prior to being.  In solving/alleviating the fundamental problems of life, Schopenhauer was rare among philosophers in considering [[philosophy]] and [[logic]] less important (or less effective) than [[art]], certain types of charitable practice (&quot;loving kindness&quot;, in his terms), and certain forms of religious discipline; Schopenhauer concluded that discursive thought (such as philosophy and logic) could neither touch nor transcend the nature of desire&amp;mdash; i.e., the will.  In ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Schopenhauer posited that humans living in the [[realm of objects]] are living in the [[realm of desire]], and thus are eternally tormented by that desire (his idea of the role of desire in life is similar to that of [[Vedanta]] [[Hinduism]] and Buddhism, and Schopenhauer draws attention to these similarities himself).

While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his [[methodology]] was resolutely [[empirical]], rather than speculative or transcendental:

{{Quotation|Philosophy... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.|Arthur Schopenhauer|''Parerga &amp; Paralipomena'', vol. i, pg. 106., E.F.J. Payne Translation}} 

{{Quotation|This actual world of what is knowable, in which we are and which is in us, remains both the material and the limit of our consideration.|Arthur Schopenhauer|''World as Will and Representation'', vol. i, pg. 273, E.F.J. Payne Translation}}

Schopenhauer's identification of the Kantian ''noumenon'' (i.e., the actually existing entity) with what we call our will deserves some explanation.  The noumenon was what Kant called the ''Ding an Sich'', the &quot;Thing in Itself&quot;, the reality that is the foundation of our [[sense|sensory]] and [[mind|mental]] representations of an external world; in Kantian terms, those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena.  Schopenhauer's assertion that what we call our will is the same as this ''noumenon'' might at first instance strike some as oddly as [[Heraclitus]]'s revelation that everything is made out of [[fire]]. 

But Kant's philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical [[philosophical skepticism]] of [[David Hume]] and his fellow [[British Empiricists]], who claimed that as far as we could tell there was [[solipsism|no outside reality]] beyond our mental representations of it.  Schopenhauer begins by arguing that Kant's demarcation between external objects, knowable only as phenomena, and the Thing in Itself of noumenon, contains a significant omission.  There is, in fact, one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception. It is our own body. 

We know our [[human anatomy|human bodies]] have [[boundary|boundaries]], and occupy space, the same way other objects known only through our named senses do.  Though we seldom think of our bodies as physical objects, we know even before reflection that it shares some of their properties.  We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck.  We know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own bodies, we would obtain similar results.  We know this even if we do not understand the [[physics]] involved.  

We know that our consciousness inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena.  Yet, our consciousness is not commensurate with our body.  Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion.  We usually are not aware of our [[lung]]s' breath, or our [[heart]]beat, unless our attention is called to it.  Our ability to control either is limited.  Our [[kidney]]s command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose.  Few of us have any idea what our [[liver]]s are doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys.  The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs.  These organs have an agenda which the conscious mind did not choose, and has limited power over.   

When Schopenhauer identifies the ''noumenon'' with the desires, needs, and impulses in us that we name &quot;will,&quot; what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will.  We cannot ''prove'' that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning.  Through will, we know&amp;mdash;without thinking&amp;mdash; that the world can stimulate us.  We suffer fear, or desire.  These states arise involuntarily.  They arise prior to reflection.  They arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay.  The rational mind is for Schopenhauer a leaf borne along in a stream of pre-reflective and largely unconscious emotion.  That stream is will; and through will, if not through logic, we can participate in the underlying reality that lies beyond mere phenomena.  It is for this reason that Schopenhauer identifies the ''noumenon'' with what we call our will.

Also, Schopenhauer's philosophy could be considered as [[panpsychism]] and [[solipsism]], and in some way [[Gnosticism|gnostic]].

== Psychology ==
Schopenhauer was perhaps even more influential in his treatment of man's [[mind]] than he was in the realm of [[philosophy]].

Philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of [[love]].  But Schopenhauer addressed it, and related concepts, forthrightly.

:&quot;We should be surprised that a matter that generally plays such an important part in the life of man [love] has hitherto been almost entirely disregarded by philosophers, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.&quot;

He gave a name to a [[force]] within man which he felt invariably had precedence over reason: the [[Will to Live]] (Wille zum Leben), defined as an inherent [[drive]] within human beings, and indeed all creatures, to stay alive and to [[reproduce]].

Schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental, but rather understood it to be an immensely powerful force lying unseen within man's [[psyche]] and dramatically shaping the [[world]]:

:&quot;The ultimate aim of all love affairs ...is more important than all other aims in man's life; and therefore it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it.&quot;
:&quot;What is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation...&quot;

These ideas foreshadowed and laid the groundwork for [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s [[Will to Power]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s concepts of the [[libido]] and the [[unconscious]] [[mind]].

== Aesthetics ==
:''See main article: [[Schopenhauer's aesthetics]]''

This wild and powerful drive to reproduce, however, caused [[suffering]] and [[pain]] in the world.  For Schopenhauer, one way to escape the suffering inherent in a world of Will was through [[art]].

Through art, Schopenhauer thought, the thinking subject could be jarred out of their limited, individual [[perspective]] to feel a sense of the [[universal (metaphysics)]] directly &amp;mdash; the &quot;universal&quot; in question, of course, was the will.  The contest of personal [[desire]] with a world that was, by nature, inimical to its satisfaction is inevitably tragical; therefore, the highest place in art was given to [[tragedy]].  [[Music]] was also given a special status in [[Schopenhauer's aesthetics]] as it did not rely upon the medium of representation to communicate a sense of the universal.  Schopenhauer believed the function of art to be a [[meditation]] on the unity of [[human nature]], and an attempt to either demonstrate or directly communicate to the [[audience]] a certain [[existential]] [[angst]] for which most forms of entertainment &amp;mdash; including bad art &amp;mdash; only provided a distraction.  A wide range of authors (from [[Thomas Hardy]] to [[Woody Allen]]) and artists have been influenced by this system of [[aesthetics]], and in the 20th century this area of Schopenhauer's work garnered more attention and praise than any other.

According to Daniel Albright (2005), &quot;Schopenhauer thought that [[music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself.&quot;

==Politics==
Schopenhauer's [[politics]] were, for the most part, a much-diminished echo of his system of ethics (the latter being expressed in ''[[Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik]]'', available in English as two separate books, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'' and ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]''; ethics also occupies about one fourth of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'').  In occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralimpomena]]'' and ''[[Manuscript Remains]]'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of limited government.  What was essential, he thought, was that the state should &quot;leave each man free to work out his own salvation&quot;, and so long as government was thus limited, he would &quot;prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats&quot; &amp;mdash; i.e., a monarch.  Schopenhauer did, however, share the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state violence, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species.  Schopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes prideful boasts of how little attention he had paid &quot;to political affairs of [his] day&quot;.  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of &quot;minding not the times but the eternities&quot;.

== Schopenhauer on women ==
Schopenhauer is also famous for his essay &quot;On Women&quot; (''Über die Weiber''), in which he expressed his opposition to what he called &quot;Teutonico-Christian stupidity&quot; on female affairs. He claimed that &quot;woman is by nature meant to obey&quot;, and opposed [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s poem in honor of women, ''Würde der Frauen''. The essay does give two compliments however: that &quot;women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are&quot; and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.  However, the latter was discounted as weakness rather than humanitarian virtue.    

The ultra-intolerant view of women contrasts with Schopenhauer's generally liberal views on other social issues: he was strongly against [[taboo]]s on issues like [[suicide]] and [[masochism]] and condemned the treatment of African [[slavery|slave]]s.  This [[polemic]] on female nature has since been fiercely attacked as [[misogyny|misogynistic]]. However, he did not hold a universally negative opinion of women in particular; one should note that Schopenhauer had a very high opinion of [[Madame de Guyon]], whose writings and biography he highly recommended.

In any case, the controversial writing has influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] to [[19th century]] [[feminism|feminists]].  While Schopenhauer's hostility to women may tell us more about his [[biography]] than about philosophy, his [[biology|biological]] analysis of the difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] in the [[twentieth century]].

==Schopenhauer on homosexuality==
Schopenhauer was also one of the first philosophers since the days of [[Greek philosophy]] to address the subject of male [[homosexuality]].  In the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' ([[1856]]), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the &quot;Metaphysics of Sexual Love.&quot;  In it, he develops the idea that since only mature men and fully adult but pre-[[menopause|menopausal]] women are capable of bearing healthy children, in early adolescence and in late middle age the sexual appetite is susceptible of being turned towards another channel.  

While there may again be more [[autobiography]] than analysis in this hypothesis, it is consistent with the general tenor of Schopenhauer's thought, which gives the Will in nature the position of setting an agenda for individual lives.  It is also one of the first attempts at portraying homosexuality as a natural phenomenon, acknowledging its existence in every culture, and seeking to explain its appearance even in those cultures whose moralities sharply condemn homosexual behaviour.

==Schopenhauer on Hegel==
Schopenhauer seems to have disliked just about everything concerning his contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. The following quotation from ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'' (page 15-16) is quite famous:

{{Quotation|If I were to say that the so-called philosophy of this fellow [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a [[pseudophilosophy|pseudo-philosophy]] paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.&lt;p&gt;
Further, if I were to say that this summus philosophus [...] scribbled nonsense quite unlike any mortal before him, so that whoever could read his most eulogized work, the so-called [[Phenomenology of the Mind]], without feeling as if he were in a madhouse, would qualify as an inmate for [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]], I should be no less right.|Arthur Schopenhauer|''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'' (page 15-16)}}

But Schopenhauer had good reason to mistrust the writings of Hegel. In his &quot;Foreword to 
the first edition&quot; of his work [[Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik]], Schopenhauer 
had found Hegel to have fallen prey to the ''[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy. 

Schopenhauer's critique of Hegel is most certainly directed at his perception that Hegel's works use deliberately impressive but ultimately vacuous [[jargon]] and [[neologism]]s, and that they contained castles of abstraction that sounded impressive but ultimately contained no verifiable content.  He also thought that his glorification of church and state were designed for personal advantage and had little to do with search for philosophical truth.  Although Schopenhauer may have appeared vain in his constant attacks on [[Hegel]], they were not necessarily devoid of merit: the [[Right Hegelians]] interpreted  Hegel as seeing the Prussian state of his day as perfect and the goal of all history up until then.

==Common Misconceptions==
Many are put off Schopenhauer by descriptions of him as an obstinate and arrogant man, who did not lead the ascetic life that he glorified in his work.  The idea that he made resignation into a command to virtue is inaccurate, as he was merely trying to explain asceticism in terms of [[metaphysics]].  He does refer to the asceticism as a state of &quot;inner peace and cheerfulness&quot;, but he also clearly states that he was not trying to recommend the denial of the will above the affirmation of the will.  Furthermore, the call to asceticism was supposed to come to select individuals as knowledge all of a sudden, rather than being a virtue that can be taught. &quot;In general,&quot; he wrote, &quot;it is a strange demand on a moralist that he should commend no other virtue than that which he himself possesses.&quot; (''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol.I, § 68)

[[Nietzsche]] seems to have made this misinterpretation, leading some people to a distorted view of Schopenhauer.  The following sentence from ''[[The Twilight of the Idols]]'' is often quoted:

{{Quotation|He has interpreted art, heroism, genius, beauty, great sympathy, knowledge, the will to truth, and tragedy, in turn, as consequences of &quot;negation&quot; or of the &quot;will's&quot; need to negate.|[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]|''[[The Twilight of the Idols]]''}}

Schopenhauer did see all these things as means to a more peaceful and enlightened way of life, but none of them were &quot;denial of the will-to-live&quot;.  Only asceticism is referred to in that way.  [[Nietzsche]] also claimed that Schopenhauer did not recognise that suffering had a redemptive quality, yet his recognition of this seems blatantly clear in part 4 of ''The World as Will and Representation''.

Also, his identification of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] with the Kantian &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; has been misunderstood.  [[Kant]] defined things-in-themselves as being beyond comprehension and that no-one could know the inner nature of a material thing.  It is sometimes thought that Schopenhauer denied this, but he did not.  What he did assert was that one could know things about the thing-in-itself.  For example, you can know that the will is a striving force, that it is endless, that it causes suffering, that it will produce boredom if unoccupied, etc.  However, he did not say that you could directly know the will.  In addition, it has sometimes been criticised that he never defined the will, but he explained that it could not be fully defined.

==Influence==
Schopenhauer is thought to have influenced the following intellectual figures and schools of thought: [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Theodule Ribot]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Max Horkheimer]], [[C. G. Jung]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[Emil Cioran]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Phenomenalism]], and [[Recursionism]].

}}{{about|the country|the prison|[[Louisiana State Penitentiary]]}}
'''Angola''' is a country in southwestern [[Africa]] bordering [[Namibia]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and [[Zambia]], and with a west coast along the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The [[exclave]] province [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] has a border with [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]]. A former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony, it has considerable natural resources, among which oil and diamonds are the most relevant.  The country is nominally a [[democracy]] and is formally named the '''Republic of Angola''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''República de Angola'', [[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[IPA]]: /{{IPA|ʁɛ.'pu.βli.kɐ dɨ ɐ̃.'ɣɔ.lɐ}}/).

==Origin and history of the name==

The name '''Angola''' is a Portuguese derivation of the [[Bantu language|Bantu]] word N’gola, being the title of the native rulers of the Quimbundos Kingdom in the [[16th century]], at the time of colonization by the Portuguese.

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Angola]]''

[[Image:Queen Nzinga 1657.png|thumb|left|Shows Queen Nzinga in peace negotiations with the portuguese governor in Luanda, 1657.]]
The earliest inhabitants of the area were [[Khoisan]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They were largely replaced by Bantu tribes during [[Bantu]] [[human migration|migrations]]. In present-day Angola [[Portugal]] settled in 1483 at the river Congo, where the [[Kongo Empire|Kongo]] State, [[Ndongo]] and [[Lunda]] existed. The Kongo State stretched from modern [[Gabon]] in the north to the [[Kwanza River]] in the south. Portugal established in 1575 a Portuguese colony at [[Luanda]] based on the slave trade. The Portuguese gradually took control of the coastal strip throughout the 16th century by a series of treaties and wars. They formed the colony of Angola. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] occupied Luanda from 1641-48, providing a boost for anti-Portuguese states. 

In 1648 Portugal retook Luanda and initiated a process of military conquest of the Kongo and Ndongo states that ended with Portuguese victory in 1671. Full Portuguese administrative control of the interior didn't occur until the beginning of the 20th century. In 1951 the colony was restyled as an overseas province, also called Portuguese West Africa. When Portugal refused a decolonization process three independence movements emerged: 
* the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (''Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola'' MPLA), with a base among [[Kimbundu]] and the mixed-race intelligentsia of Luanda, and links to communist parties in Portugal and the [[Eastern Bloc]]; 
* the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (''Frente Nacional de Libertação de Angola'', FNLA), with an ethnic base in the Bakongo region of the north and links to the [[United States]] and the [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Mobutu]] regime in [[Zaire]]; and
* the [[National Union for Total Independence of Angola]] (''União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola'', UNITA), led by [[Jonas Savimbi|Jonas Malheiro Savimbi]] with an ethnic and regional base in the Ovimbundu heartland in the center of the country. 

After a 14 year independence guerrilla war, and the overthrow of fascist Portugal's government by a military coup, Angola's nationalist parties began to negotiate for independence in January 1975.  Independence was to be declared in November 1975.  Almost immediately, a [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] broke out between MPLA, UNITA and FNLA, exacerbated by foreign intervention.  South African troops struck an alliance of convenience with UNITA and invaded Angola in August 1975 to ensure that there would be no interference (by a newly independent Angolan state) in [[Namibia]], which was then under South African control (Hodges, 2001, 11). Cuban troops came to the support of the MPLA in October 1975, enabling them to control the capital, [[Luanda]], and hold off the South African forces.  The MPLA declared itself to be the de facto government of the country when independence was formally declared in November, with [[Agostinho Neto]] as the first President.  

In 1976, the FNLA was defeated by a combination of MPLA and [[Cuba|Cuban]] troops, leaving the Marxist MPLA and UNITA (backed by the United States and South Africa) to fight for power.  

The conflict raged on, fuelled by the geopolitics of the Cold War and by the ability of both parties to access Angola's natural resources.  The MPLA drew upon the revenues of off-shore oil resources, while UNITA accessed alluvial diamonds that were easily smuggled through the region's very porous borders (LeBillon, 1999).

In 1991, the factions agreed to turn Angola into a multiparty state, but after the current president [[José Eduardo dos Santos]] of MPLA won UN supervised elections, UNITA claimed there was fraud and fighting broke out again.

A 1994 peace accord ([[Lusaka]] protocol) between the government and UNITA provided for the integration of former UNITA [[insurgent]]s into the government. A national unity government was installed in 1997, but serious fighting resumed in late 1998, rendering hundreds of thousands of people homeless. President José Eduardo dos Santos suspended the regular functioning of democratic instances due to the conflict.

On [[February 22]] [[2002]], Jonas Savimbi, the leader of UNITA, was shot dead and a cease-fire was reached by the two factions. UNITA gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of major opposition party. Although the political situation of the country seems to be normalizing, president dos Santos still hasn't allowed regular democratic processes to take place. Among Angola's major problems are a serious humanitarian crisis (a result of the prolonged war), the abundance of [[minefield]]s, and the actions of guerrilla movements fighting for the independence of the northern exclave of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] ([[Frente para a Libertação do Enclave de Cabinda]]).

Angola, like many sub-Saharan nations, is subject to periodic outbreaks of infectious diseases. In April 2005, Angola was in the midst of an [[Marburg virus#2004-2005 outbreak in Angola|outbreak]] of the [[Marburg virus]] which was rapidly becoming the worst outbreak of a haemorrhagic fever in recorded history, with over 237 deaths recorded out of 261 reported cases, and having spread to 7 out of the 18 provinces as of [[April 19]], [[2005]].

==Politics==
''Main article: [[Politics of Angola]]''

The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Prime Minister (currently [[Fernando da Piedade Dias dos Santos]]) and Council of Ministers. Currently, political power is concentrated in the Presidency. The Council of Ministers, composed of all government ministers and vice ministers, meets regularly to discuss policy issues. Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the president. The Constitutional Law of 1992 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary law but is weak and fragmented, and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review has never been constituted despite statutory authorization.

The 27 year long civil war has ravaged the country's political and social institutions. The UN estimates of 1.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), while generally the accepted figure for war-affected people is 4 million. Daily conditions of life throughout the country and specifically Luanda (population approximately 4 million) mirror the collapse of administrative infrastructure as well as many social institutions. The ongoing grave economic situation largely prevents any government support for social institutions. Hospitals are without medicines or basic equipment, schools are without books, and public employees often lack the basic supplies for their day-to-day work.

The president has announced the government's intention to hold elections in 2006. These elections would be the first since 1992 and would serve to elect both a new president and a new National Assembly.

==Geography==
[[Image:Angola map.png|thumb|300px|Map of Angola]]
[[Image:LuandaJuin2005-1-br.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Luanda]], the Angolan capital]]
''Main article: [[Geography of Angola]]''

Angola is bordered by [[Namibia]] to the south, [[Zambia]] to the east, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north-east, and the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. The [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] also borders the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the north. Angola's capital, [[Luanda]], lies on the Atlantic coast in the north-west of the country.

Angola is divided into an arid coastal strip stretching from Namibia to Luanda; a wet, interior highland; a dry savanna in the interior south and southeast; and rain forest in the north and in Cabinda. The [[Zambezi River]] and several tributaries of the Congo River have their sources in Angola.

===Exclaves and enclaves===
The [[exclave]] province of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] borders with both the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The latter's only oceanic access, 60 kilometres (37 [[mile|mi]]) in width, divides Angola from Cabinda. The population stands at around 300,000, two-thirds of which inhabit the surroundings in a generally stable state on Congolese and Zairian territory. The Angolan central government has yet to put a definitive end to the Cabindese secessionist movement.

==Economy==
''Main article: [[Economy of Angola]]''

Angola is an economy in disarray because of a quarter century of nearly continuous warfare. Despite its abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports.  Control of the oil industry is consolidated in [[Sonangol Group]], a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government.  Notwithstanding the signing of a peace accord in November 1994, millions of land mines remain, rural violence is a possibility, and many farmers are reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the country's food must still be imported. Despite the increase in the pace of civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew by an estimated 4% in 1999. The government introduced new currency denominations in 1999, including a 1 and 5 kwanza note. Expanded oil production brightens prospects for 2000, but internal strife discourages investment outside of the petroleum sector. With the advent of peace in 2002 a strategic partnership with China is set in motion, so huge investments by Chinese companies are now in place, especially in the construction sector and more recently in the metallurgical sector.

==Demographics==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Angola]]''

Angola has three main ethnic groups, each speaking a Bantu language: [[Ovimbundu]] 37%, [[Kimbundu]] 25%, and [[Bakongo]] 13%. Other groups include [[Chokwe]] (or [[Lunda]]), [[Ganguela]], [[Nhaneca-Humbe]], [[Ambo]], [[Herero]], and [[Xindunga]]. In addition, ''[[mestiço]]s'' (Angolans of mixed European and African family origins) amount to about 2%, with a small (1%) population of whites, mainly ethnically [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]. Portuguese make up the largest non-Angolan population, with at least 30,000 (though many native-born Angolans can claim Portuguese nationality under Portuguese law). In [[1975]], 250,000 [[Cuba]]n soldiers settled Angola to help the MPLA forces to fight for its independence. These Cubans are of European and [[Asia]]n (mostly [[Chinese Cuban| Chinese]] descent, while others include those of pure [[Afro-Cuban|African]] and [[mulatto]] descent, who has ancestors in Angola. But in [[1989]], almost all Cubans went out of the country after a peace agreement has been signed between Angola, Cuba, and [[South Africa]]. Portuguese is both the official and predominant language, spoken in the homes of about two-thirds of the population, and as a secondary language by many more. Cubans speak [[Spanish language]], but almost none of their descendants speak it.

The great majority of the inhabitants are of Bantu stock with some admixture in the Congo district. In the south-east are various tribes of Bushmen. The best-known of the Bantu tribes are the Ba-Kongo (Ba-Fiot), who dwell chiefly in the north, and the [[Abunda]] (Mbunda, Ba-Bundo), who occupy the central part of the province, which takes its name from the Ngola tribe of Abunda. Another of these tribes, the Bangala, living on the west bank of the upper Kwango, must not be confused with the Bangala of the middle Congo. In the Abunda is a considerable strain of Portuguese blood. The Ba-Lunda inhabit the Lunda district. Along the upper Kunene and in other districts of the plateau are settlements of Boers, the Boer population being about 2000. In the coast towns the majority of the white inhabitants are Portuguese. The Mushi-Kongo and other divisions of the Ba-Kongo retain curious traces of the Christianity professed by them in the 16th and 17th centuries and possibly later. Crucifixes are used as potent fetish charms or as symbols of power passing down from chief to chief; whilst every native has a &quot;Santu&quot; or Christian name and is dubbed dom or dona. [[Fetishism]] is the prevailing religion throughout the province. The dwelling-places of the natives are usually small huts of the simplest construction, used chiefly as sleeping apartments; the day is spent in an open space in front of the hut protected from the sun by a roof of palm or other leaves. Despite all that, Catholicism remains the dominant religion, although recently an increasing number of churches are claiming more followers, particularly evangelicals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Angola Map.jpg|right||thumb|300px|Map of Angola]]
[[Angola]] is located on the [[South Atlantic]] Coast of West [[Africa]] between [[Namibia]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]]. It also is bordered by the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Zambia]] to the east. The country is divided into an arid coastal strip stretching from Namibia to [[Luanda]]; a wet, interior highland; a dry [[savanna]] in the interior south and southeast; and [[rain forest]] in the north and in [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]. The [[Zambezi River]] and several tributaries of the [[Congo River]] have their sources in Angola. The coastal strip is tempered by the cool [[Benguela]] current, resulting in a climate similar to coastal [[Peru]] or [[Baja California]]. There is a short rainy season lasting from February to April. Summers are hot and dry, while winters are mild. The interior highlands have a mild climate with a rainy season from November through April followed by a cool dry season from May to October. Elevations generally range from 3,000 to 6,000 feet (900 to 1,800 m). The far north and Cabinda enjoy rain throughout much of the year. 

The coast is for the most part flat, with occasional low cliffs and bluffs of red [[sandstone]]. There is but one deep inlet of the sea - [[Great Fish Bay]] (or [[Baía dos Tigres]]). Farther north are [[Port Alexander]], [[Little Fish Bay]] and [[Lobito Bay]], while shallower bays are numerous. Lobito Bay has water sufficient to allow large ships to unload close inshore. The coast plain extends inland for a distance varying from 30 to 100 miles (48 to 165 km). This region is in general sparsely watered and somewhat sterile. The approach to the great central plateau of Africa is marked by a series of irregular terraces. This intermediate mountain belt is covered with luxuriant vegetation. Water is fairly abundant, though in the dry season obtainable only by digging in the sandy beds of the rivers. The plateau has an altitude ranging from 4000 to 6000 ft (1,200 to 1,800 m). It consists of well-watered, wide, rolling plains, and low hills with scanty vegetation. In the east the tableland falls away to the basins of the Congo and Zambezi, to the south it merges into a barren sandy [[desert]]. A large number of rivers make their way westward to the sea; they rise, mostly, in the mountain belt, and are unimportant, the only two of any size being the Kwanza and the Kunene, separately noticed. The mountain chains which form the edge of the plateau, or diversify its surface, run generally parallel to the coast, as [[Tala Mugongo]] (4400 ft., 1350 m), [[Chella]] and [[Vissecua]] (5250 ft. to 6500 ft. or 1500 to 2000 m). In the district of [[Benguela]] are the highest points of the province, viz. [[Loviti]] (7780 ft., 2370 m), in 12° 5' S., and [[Mt. Elonga]] (7550 ft., 2300 m). South of the Kwanza is the volcanic mountain [[Caculo-Cabaza]] (3300 ft., 1000 m). From the tableland the [[Kwango]] and many other streams flow north to join the [[Kasai River]] (one of the largest affluents of the Congo), which in its upper course forms for fully 300 mi (490 km). the boundary between Angola and the Congo State. In the south-east part of the province the rivers belong either to the [[Zambezi]] system, or, like the [[Okavango River|Okavango]], drain to [[Lake Ngami]].

== Geology ==

The rock formations of Angola are met with in three distinct regions:

# the [[littoral]] zone,
# the median zone formed by a series of hills more or less parallel with the coast,
# the central plateau.

The central plateau consists of ancient [[crystalline rock]]s with [[granite]]s overlain by [[unfossiliferous]] sandstones and conglomerates of [[Paleozoic]] age. The outcrops are largely hidden under [[laterite]]. The median zone is composed largely of crystalline rocks with granites and some Palaeozoic unfossiliferous rocks. The [[littoral]] zone contains the only [[fossiliferous]] strata. These are of [[Tertiary Age|Tertiary]] and [[Cretaceous]] ages, the latter rocks resting on a reddish sandstone of older date. The Cretaceous rocks of the Dombe Grande region (near Benguella) are of [[Albian age]] and belong to the ''[[Acanthoceras mamillari]]'' zone. The beds containing ''[[Schloenbachia inflata]]'' are referable to the [[Gault]]. Rocks of Tertiary age are met with at Dombe Grande, Mossamedes and near Loanda. The sandstones with [[gypsum]], [[copper]] and [[sulfur]] of Dombe are doubtfully considered to be of [[Triassic]] age. Recent eruptive rocks, mainly [[basalt]]s, form a line of hills almost bare of vegetation between Benguella and Mossamedes. Nepheline basalts and [[liparite]]s occur at Dombe Grande. The presence of [[gum copal]] in considerable quantities in the superficial rocks is characteristic of certain regions.

== Climate ==

Like the rest of tropical Africa, Angola experiences distinct, alternating rainy and dry seasons. It is semiarid in South and along coast to Luanda; North has cool, dry season (May to October) and hot, rainy season (November to April).  In the interior, above 3300 ft. (1000 m), the temperature and rainfall decrease.  The plateau climate is healthy and invigorating.  The mean annual temperature at [[São Salvador do Congo]] is 22.2° C (72.5° F); at [[Loanda]], 23.3° C (74.3° F); and at [[Caconda]], 19.5° C (67.2° F).  The climate is greatly influenced by the prevailing [[wind]]s, which arc W., S.W. and S.S.W.  Two seasons are distinguished - the cool, from June to September; and the rainy, from October to May.  The heaviest [[rainfall]] occurs in April, and is accompanied by violent storms.

== Terrain ==
Angola has three principal natural regions: the coastal lowland, characterized by low plains and terraces; hills and mountains, rising inland from the coast into a great escarpment; and an area of high plains, called the high plateau (planalto), which extends eastward from the escarpment. The highest point in Angola is [[Morro de Moco]], at 2,620 m.

===Coastal lowland===
The coastal lowland rises from the sea in a series of low terraces. This region varies in width from about 25 kilometers near Benguela to more than 150 kilometers in the Cuanza River Valley just south of Angola's capital, Luanda, and is markedly different from Angola's highland mass. The Atlantic Ocean's cold, northwardflowing Benguela Current substantially reduces precipitation along the coast, making the region relatively arid or nearly so south of Benguela (where it forms the northern extension of the Namib Desert), and quite dry even in its northern reaches. Even where, as around Luanda, the average annual rainfall may be as much as fifty centimeters, it is not uncommon for the rains to fail. Given this pattern of precipitation, the far south is marked by sand dunes, which give way to dry scrub along the middle coast. Portions of the northern coastal plain are covered by thick brush.

===Hills and mountains===
The belt of hills and mountains parallels the coast at distances ranging from 20 kilometers to 100 kilometers inland. The Cuanza River divides the zone into two parts. The northern part rises gradually from the coastal zone to an average elevation of 500 meters, with crests as high as 1,000 meters to 1,800 meters. South of the Cuanza River, the hills rise sharply from the coastal lowlands and form a high escarpment, extending from a point east of Luanda and running south through Namibia. The escarpment reaches 2,400 meters at its highest point, southeast of the town of Sumbe, and is steepest in the far south in the Serra da Chela mountain range.

===High plateau===
The high plateau lies to the east of the hills and mountains and dominates Angola's terrain. The surface of the plateau is typically flat or rolling, but parts of the Benguela Plateau and the Humpata Highland area of the Huíla Plateau in the south reach heights of 2,500 meters and more. The Malanje Plateau to the north rarely exceeds 1,000 meters in height. The Benguela Plateau and the coastal area in the immediate environs of Benguela and Lobito, the Bié Plateau, the Malanje Plateau, and a small section of the Huíla Plateau near the town of Lubango have long been among the most densely settled areas in Angola.

==Drainage==

Most of the country's many rivers originate in central Angola, but their patterns of flow are diverse and their ultimate outlets varied. A number of rivers flow in a more or less westerly course to the Atlantic Ocean, providing water for irrigation in the dry coastal strip and the potential for hydroelectric power, only some of which had been realized by 1988. Two of Angola's most important rivers, the Cuanza and the Cunene, take a more indirect route to the Atlantic, the Cuanza flowing north and the Cunene flowing south before turning west. The Cuanza is the only river wholly within Angola that is navigable--for nearly 200 kilometers from its mouth- -by boats of commercially or militarily significant size. The Congo River, whose mouth and western end form a small portion of Angola's northern border with Zaire, is also navigable.

North of the Lunda Divide a number of important tributaries of the Congo River flow north to join it, draining Angola's northeast quadrant. South of the divide some rivers flow into the Zambezi River and thence to the Indian Ocean, others to the Okavango River (as the Cubango River is called along the border with Namibia and in Botswana) and thence to the Okavango Swamp in Botswana. The tributaries of the Cubango River and several of the southern rivers flowing to the Atlantic are seasonal, completely dry much of the year.

==Land use and hazards==

'''Natural resources:''' [[petroleum]], [[diamond]]s, [[iron]] ore, [[phosphates]], [[copper]], [[feldspar]], [[gold]], [[bauxite]], [[uranium]]

'''Land use:'''
* ''arable land:'' 2.41%
* ''permanent crops:'' 0.4%
* ''other:'' 97.19% (1999 est.)

'''Irrigated land:''' 750 km² (1998 est.)

'''Natural hazards:''' locally heavy rainfall causes periodic flooding on the plateau

== Environment - current issues ==
Overuse of [[pasture]]s and subsequent [[soil erosion]] attributable to population pressures; [[desertification]]; [[deforestation]] of tropical rain forest, in response to both international demand for tropical [[timber]] and to domestic use as fuel, resulting in loss of [[biodiversity]]; soil erosion contributing to [[water pollution]] and [[silting]] of rivers and dams; inadequate supplies of potable water

'''Environment - international agreements:'''
* ''party to:'' Biodiversity, [[Climate Change]], Desertification, [[Law of the Sea]], [[Ozone Layer Protection]], Ship Pollution ([[MARPOL 73/78]])
* ''signed, but not ratified:'' none of the selected agreements

== Flora and fauna ==

Both [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] are those characteristic of the greater part of tropical Africa.  As far south as Benguela the coast region is rich in [[oil palm]]s and [[mangrove]]s.  In the Northern part of the province are dense forests.  In the South towards the Kunene are regions of dense [[thorn scrub]].  [[Rubber]] vines and trees are abundant, but in some districts their number has been considerably reduced by the primitive methods adopted by native collectors of rubber.  The species most common are various root rubbers, notably the ''Carpodinus chylorrhiza''.  This species and other varieties of carpodinus are very widely distributed. [[Landolphia]]s are also found.  The [[coffee]], [[cotton]] and [[Guinea pepper]] plants are indigenous, and the [[tobacco]] plant flourishes in several districts.  Among the trees are several which yield excellent timber, such as the [[tacula]] (''Pterocarpus tinctorius''), which grows to an immense size, its wood being blood-red in colour, and the Angola [[mahogany]].  The [[bark]] of the [[musuemba]] (''Albizzia coriaria'') is largely used in the tanning of [[leather]].  The [[mulundo]] bears a fruit about the size of a cricket ball covered with a hard green shell and containing scarlet pips like a [[pomegranate]].  The fauna includes the [[lion]], [[leopard]], [[cheetah]], [[elephant]], [[giraffe]], [[rhinoceros]], [[hippopotamus]], [[African Buffalo|buffalo]], [[zebra]], [[kudu]] and many other kinds of [[antelope]], [[wildpig]], [[ostrich]] and [[crocodile]].  Among fish are the [[barbel]], [[bream]] and [[African yellow fish]].

'''Geography - note:''' the province of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] is an [[exclave]], separated from the rest of the country by the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]

== Extreme points ==

This is a list of the '''extreme points of [[Angola]]''', the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Angola demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of [[Angola]], Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
The '''demographics of Angola''' consist of three main ethnic groups, each speaking a [[Bantu language]]: [[Ovimbundu]] 37%, [[Kimbundu]] 25%, and [[Bakongo]] 13%. Other groups include [[Chokwe]] (or Lunda), Ganguela, Nhaneca-Humbe, Ambo, Herero, and Xindunga. In addition, mixed racial (European and Africa) people amount to about 2%, with a small (1%) population of whites, mainly ethnically [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]. Portuguese make up the largest non-Angolan population, with at least 30,000 (though many native-born Angolans can claim Portuguese nationality under Portuguese law). In [[1975]], 250,000 [[Cuba]]n soldiers settled Angola to help the MPLA forces to fight for its independence. These Cubans are of European and [[Asia]]n (mostly [[Chinese Cuban| Chinese]] descent, while others include those of pure [[Afro-Cuban|African]] and [[mulatto]] descent, who has ancestors in Angola. But in [[1989]], almost all Cubans went out of the country after a peace agreement has been signed between Angola, Cuba, and [[South Africa]]. Cubans speak [[Spanish language]], but almost none of their descendants speak it. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is both the official and predominant language. 

The great majority of the inhabitants are of Bantu-Negro stock with some admixture in the Congo district with the pure negro type. In the south-east are various tribes of Bushmen. The best-known of the Bantu-Negro tribes are the Ba-Kongo (Ba-Fiot), who dwell chiefly in the north, and the Abunda (Mbunda, Ba-Bundo), who occupy the central part of the province, which takes its name from the Ngola tribe of Abunda. Another of these tribes, the Bangala, living on the west bank of the upper Kwango, must not be confounded with the Bangala of the middle [[Congo]]. In the Abunda is a considerable strain of Portuguese blood. The Ba-Lunda inhabit the Lunda district. Along the upper Kunene and in other districts of the plateau are settlements of Boers, the Boer population being about 2000. In the coast towns the majority of the white inhabitants are Portuguese. The Mushi-Kongo and other divisions of the Ba-Kongo retain curious traces of the Christianity professed by them in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and possibly later. Crucifixes are used as potent fetish charms or as symbols of power passing down from chief to chief; whilst every native has a &quot;Santu&quot; or Christian name and is dubbed dom or dona. Fetishism is the prevailing religion throughout the province. The dwelling-places of the natives are usually small huts of the simplest construction, used chiefly as sleeping apartments; the day is spent in an open space in front of the hut protected from the sun by a roof of palm or other leaves.

[[Angola]] changed from a [[Single-party state|one-party]] [[Marxist]]-[[Leninist]] system ruled by the [[MPLA]] to a formal multiparty democracy following the 1992 elections. President [[José Eduardo dos Santos|dos Santos]] won the first round election with more than 49% of the vote to [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s 40%. A runoff never has taken place. The subsequent renewal of civil war and collapse of the [[Lusaka Protocol]] have left much of this process stillborn, but democratic forms exist, notably the [[National Assembly of Angola|National Assembly]].
Currently, political power is concentrated in the Presidency. The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Prime Minister (currently [[Fernando da Piedade Dias dos Santos]]) and Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers, composed of all government ministers and vice ministers, meets regularly to discuss policy issues. Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the president. The Constitutional Law of 1992 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary law but is weak and fragmented. Courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review has never been constituted despite statutory authorization.

The 26-year long civil war has ravaged the country's political and social institutions. The UN estimates of 1.8 million [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs), while generally the accepted figure for war-affected people is 4 million. Daily conditions of life throughout the country and specifically Luanda (population approximately 4 million) mirror the collapse of administrative infrastructure as well as many social institutions. The ongoing grave economic situation largely prevents any government support for social institutions. Hospitals are without medicines or basic equipment, schools are without books, and public employees often lack the basic supplies for their day-to-day work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Economy of Angola table}}
[[Angola]]'s is the fastest-growing economy in Africa, largely due to a major oil boom, but it also ranks in the bottom 10 of socioeconomic conditions in the world. Aside from the oil sector and [[diamond]]s, it is in economic disarray because of 26 years of nearly continuous warfare. Despite abundant natural resources, output per capita remains among the world's lowest. Subsistence agriculture and dependence on humanitarian food assistance sustain the large majority of the population. Little industry exists.

By contrast, the rapidly expanding [[petroleum]] industry now producing up to 800,000 barrels (127,000 m&amp;sup3;) per day, behind only Nigeria in Africa, accounts for more than 60% of GNP and 90% of government revenues. Oil production remains largely offshore and has few linkages with other sectors of the economy. Block Zero, located of the enclave of Cabinda, provides the majority of Angola's crude oil production. There, [[ChevronTexaco]], through its subsidiary Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, is the operator with a 39.2% share, with [[SONANGOL]] (the Angolan state oil company), [[Total S.A.|Total]], and [[ENI-Agip]] splitting up the rest. ChevronTexaco also operates Angola's first producing deepwater section, Block 14, which started pumping in January 2000. The U.S. takes more than half of Angola's production, by far the largest importer. Exports to Asian countries have grown rapidly in recent years, however, especially China. Significant discoveries have been made on deepwater Blocks 15, 17, 18, and 24, with [[ExxonMobil]], [[BP]], [[Statoil]], [[Norsk Hydro]], and [[Agip]] having major interests. Total operates Angola's one refinery (in Luanda) as a joint venture with SONANGOL; plans for a second refinery in Lobito are moving forward.

In the last decade of the colonial period, Angola was a major African food exporter but now is forced to import almost all its food. Because of severe wartime conditions, including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside, agricultural activities have been brought to a near standstill. Some efforts to recover have gone forward, however, notably in fisheries. Coffee production, though a fraction of its pre-1975 level, is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports. In sharp contrast to a bleak picture of devastation and bare subsistence is expanding oil production, now almost half of GDP and 90% of exports, at 800,000 barrels (127,000 m&amp;sup3;) a day. Diamonds make up most of the remaining exports--and have provided much of the revenue for [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s [[UNITA]] rebellion through illicit trade. Other rich resources await development: gold, forest products, fisheries, iron ore, coffee, and countless fruits.

An economic reform effort was launched in 1998. In April 2000, Angola started an International Monetary Fund (IMF) Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). The program formally lapsed in June 2001, but the IMF remains engaged. In this context, the Government of Angola has succeeded in unifying exchange rates and has raised fuel, electricity, and water rates. The Commercial Code, telecommunications law, and Foreign Investment Code are being modernized. A privatization effort, prepared with World Bank assistance, has begun with the BCI bank. Nevertheless, a legacy of fiscal mismanagement and corruption persists.

Angola is the third-largest trading partner of the United States in Sub-Saharan Africa, largely because of its petroleum exports. The U.S. imports about 4% of its oil from Angola, a share which should continue to increase. By the same token, U.S. companies account for more than half the investment in Angola, with Chevron-Texaco leading the way. The U.S. exports industrial goods and services--primarily oilfield equipment, mining equipment, chemicals, aircraft, and food--to Angola, while principally importing petroleum. 

'''Economy - overview:''' Angola is an economy in disarray because of a quarter century of nearly continuous warfare and corruption. Despite its abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports. Notwithstanding the signing of a peace accord in November 1994, violence continues, millions of land mines remain, and many farmers are reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the country's food must still be imported. To take advantage of its rich resources - [[gold]], [[diamond]]s, extensive forests, Atlantic fisheries, and large oil deposits - Angola will need to implement the peace agreement and reform government policies. Despite the increase in the pace of civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew by an estimated 4% in 1999. The government introduced new currency denominations in 1999, including a 1 and 5 kwanza note. Expanded oil production brightens prospects for 2000, but internal strife discourages investment outside of the petroleum sector.

==Telephony==
Telephone service is limited mostly to government and business use.  96,300 [[landline|main lines]] were reported to be in use in 2003, and 130,000 [[mobile cellular]] lines were reported in 2002.  [[high frequency|HF]] [[radiotelephone]] is used extensively for military links.

The domestic system consists of a limited system of [[wire]].  It also uses [[microwave radio relay]] and [[tropospheric scatter]].

The international [[country calling code|country code]] for Angola is 244.  Angola has 2 [[Intelsat]] [[satellite earth station]]s for communications across the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  [[Fiber optic]] [[submarine cable]] ([[SAT-3/WASC]]) provides connectivity to [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

[[Angola]]'s military is called the FAA, the Portuguese acronym for [[Angolan Armed Forces]], headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defense. There are three divisions--the '''Army''', Navy ('''Marinha de Guerra''', MdG), and '''Air and Air Defense Forces''' (FANA). Total manpower is about 110,000. The army is by far the largest of the services with about 100,000 men and women. The navy numbers about 3,000 and operates several small patrol craft and barges. Air force personnel total about 7,000; its equipment includes Russian-manufactured fighters and transport planes. A small number of FAA personnel are stationed in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Kinshasa) and the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Angola}}
Froom 1975 to 1989, [[Angola]] was aligned with the [[Eastern bloc]], in particular the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]]. Since then, it has focused on improving relationships with [[Western world|Western countries]], cultivating links with other Portuguese-speaking countries, and asserting its own national interests in [[Central Africa]] through military and diplomatic intervention. In 1993, it established formal diplomatic relations with the [[United States]]. It has entered the [[Southern African Development Community]] as a vehicle for improving ties with its largely anglophone neighbors to the south. [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Namibia]] joined Angola in its military intervention in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], where Angolan troops remain in support of the [[Joseph Kabila]] government. It also has intervened in the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville) to support the existing government in that country.

Since 1998, Angola has successfully worked with the [[UN Security Council]] to impose and carry out sanctions on [[UNITA]]. More recently, it has extended those efforts to controls on conflict diamonds, the primary source of revenue for UNITA. At the same time, Angola has promoted the revival of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) as a forum for cultural exchange and expanding ties with Portugal and Brazil in particular.

'''Disputes - international:''' [[Angola]] gives shelter to thousands of refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo while thousands of Angolan refugees still remain in neighboring states as a consequence of the protracted civil wars in both states

'''Illicit drugs:''' [[Angola]] is used as a transshipment point for cocaine destined for [[Western Europe]] and other African states

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:ASJohnston.jpeg|thumb|Albert Sidney Johnston]]
'''Albert Sidney Johnston''' ([[February 2]], [[1803]] &amp;ndash; [[April 6]], [[1862]]) was a career [[U.S. Army]] officer and a [[Confederate States Army | Confederate]] [[general]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Considered by [[President of the Confederate States | Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] to be the finest general in the Confederacy, he was killed early in the war at the [[Battle of Shiloh]].

==Early life==
Johnston was born in [[Washington, Kentucky | Washington]], [[Kentucky]], the youngest son of Dr. John and Abigail Harris Johnston. His father was a native of [[Salisbury, Connecticut]]. Although Albert Johnston was born in Kentucky, he lived much of his life in [[Texas]], which he considered his home. He was educated at [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky | Lexington]] and later secured an appointment to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. In [[1826]] he graduated eighth in his class from the [[United States Military Academy]] with a commission as a [[second lieutenant]] in the 2nd U.S. [[Infantry]]. He was assigned to posts in [[New York]] and [[Missouri]] and served in the [[Black Hawk War]] in [[1832]] as chief of staff to General Henry Atlinson. In [[1829]] he married Henrietta Preston. He resigned his commission in [[1834]] to return to Kentucky to care for his dying wife. They had one son, William Preston Johnston.

==Texas Army==
In April 1834, Johnston took up farming in [[Texas]], but enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the Texas Army during the [[Texas War of Independence]] against the Republic of [[Mexico]] in [[1836]]. One month later, Johnston was promoted to [[major]] and the position of [[aide-de-camp]] to General [[Sam Houston]]. He was named [[Adjutant General]] as a [[colonel]] in the [[Republic of Texas]] Army on [[August 5]], [[1836]]. On [[January 31]], [[1837]], he became Senior Brigadier General in command of the Texas Army.

On [[February 7]], [[1837]], he fought in a [[duel]] with Texas Brig. Gen. [[Felix Huston]], challenging each other for the command of the Texas Army; Johnston refused to fire on Huston and lost the position after he was wounded in the pelvis. The second president of the [[Republic of Texas]], [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], appointed him Secretary of War on [[December 22]], [[1838]]. Johnston was to provide the defense of the Texas border against Mexican invasion, and in 1839 conducted a campaign against [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in northern Texas. In February 1840, he resigned and returned to Kentucky, where he married [[Eliza Griffin]] in [[1843]]. They settled on a large [[plantation]] he named China Grove in [[Brazoria County, Texas]].

==U.S. Army==
Johnston returned to the Texas Army during the [[Mexican-American War]] under General [[Zachary Taylor]] as a [[colonel]] of the 1st Texas Rifle Volunteers.  The enlistments of his volunteers ran out just before the [[Battle of Monterrey]].  Johnston managed to convince a few volunteers to stay and fight as he himself served as the inspector general of volunteers and fought at the battles of Monterrey and [[Battle of Buena Vista|Buena Vista]]. Johnston remained on his plantation after the war until he was appointed by [[President of the United States | President]] [[Zachary Taylor]] to the U.S. Army as a [[major]] and was made a [[U.S. Army Paymaster | paymaster]] in December of [[1849]]. He served in that role for more than five years, making six tours, and traveling more than 4,000 miles annually on the Indian frontier of Texas. He served on the Texas frontier and elsewhere in the West. In [[1855]] President [[Franklin Pierce]] appointed him colonel of the 2nd (now 5th) Cavalry, a new regiment, which he organized. As a key figure in the [[Utah War]], he led U.S. troops who established a non-Mormon government in the formerly [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|Mormon]] territory. He received a [[brevet (military) | brevet]] promotion to [[brigadier general]] in [[1857]] for his service in Utah. He spent [[1860]] in Kentucky until [[December 21]], when he sailed for California to take command of the Department of the Pacific.

==Civil War==
At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War | Civil War]], Johnston was the commander of the U.S. Army [[Department of the Pacific]] in [[California and the Civil War|California]]. He was approached by some Californians who urged him to take his forces east to join the [[Union army | Union]] against the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. He resigned his commission, [[April 9]], [[1861]], as soon as he heard of the [[secession]] of Texas. He remained in California until June. After a rapid march through the deserts of Arizona and Texas, he reached [[Richmond, Virginia]], on or about [[September 1]], [[1861]]. There Johnston was appointed a general by his friend, Jefferson Davis. On [[May 30]], [[1861]], Johnston became the second highest ranking Confederate General (after the little-known [[Samuel Cooper (general) | Samuel Cooper]]) as commander of the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War | Western Department]]. He raised the [[Army of Mississippi]] to defend Confederate lines from the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Kentucky]] and the [[Allegheny Mountains]].

Although the [[Confederate Army]] won a morale-boosting victory at [[First Bull Run]] in the East in [[1861]], matters in the West turned ugly by early [[1862]]. Johnston's subordinate generals lost [[Battle of Fort Henry | Fort Henry]] on [[February 6]], [[1862]], and [[Battle of Fort Donelson | Fort Donelson]] on [[February 16]], [[1862]], to [[Union army | Union]] [[Brigadier General | Brig. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Johnston has been faulted for poor judgment in selecting Gens. [[Lloyd Tilghman | Tilghman]] and [[John B. Floyd | Floyd]] for those crucial positions and for not supervising adequate construction of the forts. And Union Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]] captured the vital city of [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Gen. [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] was sent west to join Johnston and they organized their forces at [[Corinth, Mississippi]], planning to ambush Grant's forces at [[Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee]].

==Shiloh==
Johnston concentrated many of his forces from around the theater and launched a massive surprise attack against Grant at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] on [[April 6]], [[1862]]. As the Confederate forces overran the Union camps, Johnston seemed to be everywhere, personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line. At about 2:30 p.m., while leading one of those charges, he was wounded, taking a bullet behind his right knee. He did not think the wound serious at the time, and sent his personal physician to attend to some wounded Union soldiers instead. The bullet had in fact clipped his [[popliteal artery]] and his boot was filling up with blood. Within a few minutes Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting off of his horse, and asked him if he was wounded, to which he replied &quot;Yes, and I fear seriously.&quot; It is possible that Johnston's duel in [[1837]] had caused nerve damage or numbness to that leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result. Johnston was taken to a small ravine, where he bled to death in minutes.

Ironically, it is probable that a Confederate soldier fired the fatal round. No Union soldiers were observed to have ever gotten behind Johnston during the fatal charge, while it is known that many Confederates were firing at the Union lines while Johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers. He was the highest-ranking casualty of the war and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the Confederacy. Jefferson Davis considered him the best general in the country; this was two months before the emergence of [[Robert E. Lee]] as their pre-eminent general.

==Epitaph==
Johnston was buried in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. In [[1866]], a joint resolution of the [[Texas Legislature]] was passed to have his body reinterred to the [[Texas State Cemetery]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] (the re-interment occurred in [[1867]]). Four decades later, the state appointed [[Elisbet Ney]] to design a monument and sculpture of him to be erected at his gravesite.

The [[Texas Historical Commission]] has erected a historical marker near the entrance of what was once his [[plantation]]. An adjacent marker was erected by the San Jacinto Chapter of the [[Daughters of The Republic of Texas]] and the Lee, Roberts, and Davis Chapter of the [[United Daughters of the Confederate States of America]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Five oceans}}
The '''[[Arctic]] Ocean''', located mostly in the [[North Pole|north polar]] region, is the smallest of the world's five [[ocean]]s, and the shallowest.  Even though [[International Hydrographic Organization|IHO]] recognizes it as an ocean, [[oceanography|oceanographers]] may call it ''the Arctic Mediterranean Sea'' or simply ''the Arctic Sea'', classifying it as one of the [[mediterranean sea]]s of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Arctic_Ocean.png|right|Arctic Ocean]]

The Arctic Ocean occupies a roughly circular basin and covers an area of about 14,090,000 km² (5,440,000 mi&amp;sup2;), slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the [[United States|US]].  The coastline length is 45,389 km.  Nearly landlocked, it is surrounded by the land masses of [[Eurasia]], [[North America]], [[Greenland]], and a number of islands.  It includes [[Baffin Bay]], [[Barents Sea]], [[Beaufort Sea]], [[Chukchi Sea]], [[East Siberian Sea]], [[Greenland Sea]], [[Hudson Bay]], [[Hudson Strait]], [[Kara Sea]], [[Laptev Sea]], [[White Sea]] and other tributary bodies of water.  It is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the [[Bering Strait]] and to the Atlantic Ocean through the Greenland Sea.

An underwater [[ocean ridge]], the [[Lomonosov Ridge]], divides the Arctic Ocean into two basins: the [[Eurasian Basin|Eurasian]], or [[Nansen Basin|Nansen]], Basin, which is between 4,000 and 4,500 m (13,000 and 15,000 ft) deep, and the [[North American Basin|North American]], or [[Hyperborean Basin|Hyperborean]], Basin, which is about 4,000 m deep. The [[topography]] of the ocean bottom is marked by [[fault-block ridge]]s, [[abyssal plain|plains of the abyssal zone]], ocean deeps, and basins. The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is 1,038 m (3,407 ft), in part due to the large extent of [[continental shelf]] extant on the Eurasian side [http://www.marianatrench.com/mariana_trench-oceanography.htm].

[[Image:Polar bears near north pole.jpg|thumb|The Arctic Ocean is used by both [[marine mammal]]s and nuclear [[submarine]]s.]]
The greatest inflow of water comes from the Atlantic by way of the [[Norwegian Current]], which then flows along the Eurasian coast. Water also enters from the Pacific via the Bering Strait. The [[East Greenland Current]] carries the major outflow. [[Temperature]] and [[salinity]] vary [[season]]ally as the ice cover melts and freezes. Ice covers most of the ocean surface year-round, causing subfreezing temperatures much of the time. The Arctic is a major source of very cold air that inevitably moves toward the [[equator]], meeting with warmer air in the middle [[latitude]]s and causing [[rain]] and [[snow]]. Little marine life exists where the ocean surface is covered with ice throughout the year. Marine life abounds in open areas, especially the more southerly waters. The ocean's major ports are the [[Russia]]n cities of [[Murmansk]] and [[Arkhangelsk]] (Archangel). The Arctic Ocean is important as the shortest air route between the Pacific coast of North America and Europe overflies it.

Major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern access to the Pacific Ocean via the Bering Strait); strategic location between North America and Russia; shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern and western Russia; floating research stations operated by the US and Russia; maximum snow cover in March or April about 20 to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean; snow cover lasts about 10 months.

==Climate==
[[image:north pole september ice-pack 1978-2002.png|thumb|Extent of the Arctic ice-pack in September, 1978-2002]]
[[image:north pole february ice-pack 1978-2002.png|thumb|Extent of the Arctic ice-pack in February, 1978-2002]]
[[Polar climate]] characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature ranges; winters characterized by continuous darkness, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies; summers characterized by continuous daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak cyclones with rain or snow.

There is considerable seasonal variation in how much [[pack ice]] covers the Arctic Ocean.



==Elevation extremes==
* ''lowest point:'' [[Fram Basin]] &amp;minus;4,665 m (according to [http://www.marianatrench.com/mariana_trench-oceanography.htm], the Arctic Ocean's Eurasian Basin deepest point is at &amp;minus;5,450 m (17,881 ft))
* ''highest point:'' sea level 0 m

==Natural resources==
Oil and gas fields, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates, [[fish]], marine mammals ([[Seal (mammal)|seals]] and [[Whale|whales]]).

The political dead zone near the center of the sea is also at the center of a mounting dispute between the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[Norway]], and [[Denmark]]. It is considered significant because of its potential to contain as much as or more than a quarter of the world's oil and gas resources, the tapping of which could greatly alter the flow of the global energy market. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4354036.stm#map The Arctic's New Gold Rush - BBC]

==Natural hazards==
Ice islands occasionally break away from northern [[Ellesmere Island]]; icebergs calved from glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern [[Canada]]; permafrost on islands; virtually ice locked from October to June; ships subject to superstructure icing from October to May.

==Environment - current issues==
Endangered marine species include [[Walrus|walruses]] and whales; fragile [[ecosystem]] slow to change and slow to recover from disruptions or damage; thinning polar icepack; seasonal hole in [[ozone layer]] over the [[North Pole]].

Reduction of the area of Arctic sea ice will have an effect on the planet's [[albedo]], thus possibly affecting [[global warming]].  Many scientists are presently concerned that warming temperatures in the Arctic may cause large amounts of fresh, Arctic Ocean meltwater to enter the North Atlantic, possibly disrupting global [[thermohaline circulation|ocean current patterns]]. Potentially severe changes in the Earth's climate might then ensue.

==Ports and harbors==

==Transportation - note==
Sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land routes; the [[Northwest Passage]] (North America) and [[Northern Sea Route]] ([[Eurasia]]) are important seasonal waterways.

==Exploration==
The first surface crossing of the Arctic Ocean was led by Wally Herbert in [[1969]], in a dogsled expedition from [[Alaska]] to [[Svalbard]] with air support. See also [[Northwest Passage]], [[Open Polar Sea]].

[[Image:Data2.jpg|thumbnail|200px|The android [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], portrayed by [[Brent Spiner]], from the TV series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'']]An '''android''' is an [[artificial]]ly created [[robot]], an [[automaton]], that resembles a [[human]] being usually both in appearance and behavior.  The word derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''andr-'', &quot; meaning &quot;[[man]], male&quot;, and the suffix ''-eides'', used to mean &quot;of the [[species]]; alike&quot; (from ''eidos'' &quot;species&quot;).  The word ''[[droid]]'', a robot in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe, is derived from this meaning.

In the semantic sense the word &quot;android&quot; is a misnomer. The intended meaning is &quot;an artificial human being like being&quot;, while the literal translation is &quot;an artificial male being&quot;.  The word ''andros'' has definite meaning of &quot;male human being&quot; in Greek, while the word ''man'' can mean either &quot;male human being&quot; or &quot;human being in general&quot;.  The gender-neutral word for human being in Greek is ''anthropos'', and the correct word for an artificial human being-like automaton would be [[anthropoid]].

__TOC__
== Usage and distinctions ==
Unlike the terms ''[[robot]]'' (a &quot;[[mechanics|mechanical]]&quot; being) and ''[[cyborg]]'' (a being that is partly [[organic compound|organic]] and partly mechanical), the word ''android'' has been used in literature and other media to denote several different kinds of [[artificial life|artificially constructed beings]]:

* a robot that closely resembles a human
* a cyborg that closely resembles a human
* an artificially created, yet primarily organic, being that closely resembles a human

Although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: ''[[simulacra]]'' (devices that exhibit likeness) and ''[[automata]]'' (devices that have independence).

The term android was first used by the French author [[Mathias Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]] (1838-1889) in his work ''[[Tomorrow's Eve]]'', featuring an artificial human-like robot named Hadaly.  As said by the officer in the story, &quot;In this age of Realien advancement, who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls.&quot;

Although [[Karel Capek|Karel &amp;#268;apek]]'s robots in ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'' (1921)&amp;mdash;the play that introduced the word &quot;robot&quot; to the world&amp;mdash;were organic artificial humans, the word ''robot'' has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings.  The term android can mean either one of these, while a [[cyborg]] (&quot;cybernetic organism&quot; or &quot;bionic man&quot;) would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts.

== Ambiguity ==
Historically, [[science fiction]] [[authors]] have used &quot;android&quot; in a greater diversity of ways than the terms &quot;robot&quot; and &quot;cyborg&quot;.  In some fiction works, the primary difference between a robot and android is only skin-deep, with androids being made to look almost exactly like humans on the outside, but with internal mechanics exactly the same as that of robots.  In other stories, authors have defined android to indicate a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation.  Other definitions of android fall somewhere in between.

The character [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], from the [[television series]] ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', is described as an android.  Data became [[intoxication|intoxicated]] in an early episode (&quot;[[The Naked Now (TNG episode)|The Naked Now]]&quot;) and is later referred to having &quot;bioplast sheeting&quot; for skin (&quot;[[The Most Toys (TNG episode)|The Most Toys]]&quot;), perhaps suggesting that he was initially intended by the writers to be at least partially organic.  Otherwise, Data was shown to be mechanical throughout and this often became a central plot theme.

The [[Replicant]]s from the movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'' were [[bioengineering|bioengineered]] organic beings.  While they were not referred to as either robots or androids in the movie, the screenplay was originally based on a [[novel]] by [[Philip K. Dick]] called ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''

In the video game [[Beneath a Steel Sky]], genetically engineered androids similar to Blade Runner's Replicants are a central plot theme.  However, despite their organic makeup, their behavior is programmed by computer.

The robots of &amp;#268;apek's ''R.U.R.'' were organic in nature.  Today, an author writing a similar story might very well be inclined to call them androids.

The character Ash in the movie ''[[Alien (movie)|Alien]]'', another artificial organic being, is often referred to as an android (though not in the dialogue of the movie itself).  Similarly, the character Bishop in ''[[Aliens (movie)|Aliens]]'' and ''[[Alien³]]'' is a more advanced android commonly called a Synthetic, but prefers to be called an &quot;artificial person&quot;.  Much later in the series timeline, the character Call in ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' is ashamed of being an android. 

[[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] from the [[Star Wars]] movies are referred to as ''droids''.  While C-3PO could reasonably be called an android because he is humanoid in appearance, the squat cylinder R2-D2 is only humanoid in behavior.

In the movie ''[[A.I. (movie)|A.I.]]'', the robotic characters are called ''mechanoids'', but the film is loosely based on a short story written by [[Brian Aldiss]] called &quot;Supertoys Last All Summer Long&quot;, in which the central character David is called an android (by which Aldiss seemed to be referring to an organic creation).

In the anime/manga Chobits, Androids are known as &quot;Persicoms&quot;, essentially computers in a man-made body.  The series does not go into their internal composition, but it is assumed to be artificial with a very realistic outside.  One of the key points of this series was a special type of persicom named a &quot;Chobit&quot;, a persicom that had free will and the ability to fall in love and have emotions.

== Androids in fiction ==
Thus far, androids have remained mostly within the domain of [[science fiction]] and, frequently, in [[film]] and [[television]].  However, some &quot;[[humanoid robot]]s&quot; exist.

One of the earliest android characters is Otho from the [[Captain Future]] stories of [[Edmond Hamilton]].  Otho's construction is never discussed but he is much more human-like than his companion Grag, a mechanical [[robot]].

[[Isaac Asimov]]'s robot stories are mostly about androids; many are collected in ''[[I, Robot]]'' (1950).  They promulgated a set of rules of ethics for androids and robots (see [[Three Laws of Robotics]]) that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject.  Most of Asimov's robots appear too artificial to be mistaken for human beings, with the notable exceptions of R. Jander Panell, [[R. Daneel Olivaw]] and Andrew Martin.

Perhaps the most famous android is [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], played by actor [[Brent Spiner]], of the series ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' (1987&amp;ndash;1994) and several spin-off motion pictures; this character was largely inspired by another android character created by [[Gene Roddenberry]] for ''[[The Questor Tapes]]''.  Data's immediate 'family' – brothers [[Lore (Star Trek)|Lore]] and [[B-4 (Star Trek)|B-4]] et al., daughter [[Lal]], and 'mother' [[Juliana Tainer|Dr. Juliana Tainer]] – were also androids (and the fembots are properly, though rarely, referred to as [[gynoid]]s) from the same creator, [[Noonien Soong|Dr. Noonien Soong]].

Earlier in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979), the Ilia [[probe]] – a precisely duplicated biomechanical [[drone]] of [[Ilia|Lieutenant Ilia]], with some of her [[emotion]]s intact – was dispatched by [[V'ger]] to gather information about the crew of the [[starship]] ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]''.

In the TV series ''[[Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda]]'' (2000&amp;ndash;2005), the [[gynoid]] [[Rommie]] is an extension of [[Andromeda Ascendant|the starship]]'s [[artificial intelligence|AI]] [[operating system]], represented by an [[avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]] of Rommie.

In the re-imagined series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2003)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' (2003&amp;ndash;), the gynoid [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]] is one of a (seductive) variant of the [[antagonist]]ic, robotic [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]] that is used to infiltrate the fleeing [[human]] [[Twelve Colonies|Colonial forces]] and, particularly, the mind of the scientist [[Gaius Baltar|Dr. Gaius Baltar]].

Androids (Jinzou Ningen in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]; meaning 'artificial human') are also a race in ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', and ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]''.  The androids' names were only numbers (such as Android #13 or Android #20). They were created by Dr. Gero, Dr. Muu, and the Red Ribbon Army.  Some are entirely artificial and some are created from humans and can be considered cyborgs.

Jinzo Ningen [[Kikaider]] was the first [[manga]] and [[tokusatsu]] series to feature an android protagonist.

The series [[Xenosaga]] borrows Villiers' original term Realian when referring to a race of beings created by Vector Corporation.  Two playable characters are androids (MOMO and KOS-MOS). One is refered to as a Realian while the second is simply an android.

In their respective series by [[Capcom]], [[Mega Man]] was initially called a &quot;humanoid&quot;, which was then simplified to robot.  [[Mega Man X|X]], a later version, is said to be more advanced, more independent of thought, and closer to an android.  Other beings, based off his design, are called [[Reploids]].

Many more examples may be found in this [[list of fictional robots]].

'''Alberta''' is one of [[Canada|Canada's]] [[Provinces of Canada|provinces]].   It celebrated 100 years as a province on [[September 1]], [[2005]].

Alberta is located in western Canada.  It is bounded on the west by the province of British Columbia, on the north by the Northwest Territories, on the east by the province of Saskatchewan, and on the south by the United States of America (State of Montana).

Alberta's capital is the city of [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], located just south of the centre of the province.  The most populous city and metropolitan area is [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]]. Calgary is also the province's busiest transportation hub (for road, air, and rail) and is one of Canada's major commerce centres. Other major municipalities include [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], [[Lethbridge, Alberta|Lethbridge]], [[Medicine Hat, Alberta|Medicine Hat]], [[Fort McMurray, Alberta|Fort McMurray]], [[Grande Prairie, Alberta|Grande Prairie]], [[Camrose, Alberta|Camrose]], [[Lloydminster, Alberta|Lloydminster]], [[Wetaskiwin, Alberta|Wetaskiwin]], [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], and [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper]]. See also: [[List of communities in Alberta]].

The [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] of the province is Hon. [[Ralph Klein]], Progressive Conservative.  See also [[List of Alberta Premiers]].

Alberta is named after [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise Caroline Alberta]] (1848-1939), the fourth daughter of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]].  Princess Louise was also the wife of [[John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Sir John Campbell]], who was the [[Governor General of Canada]] from 1878-1883.  [[Lake Louise]] was also named in honour of Princess Louise.

==Geography==
:''Main article: [[Geography of Alberta]]''

Alberta is in [[western Canada]], and covers an area of 661,190 km² (255,287 mi²). To the south, it borders the US state of [[Montana]] at a latitude of 49°N, or the [[49th parallel north|49th Parallel]]. To the east at a longitude of 110°W, it borders the province of [[Saskatchewan]]. At 60°N, it is bordered by the [[Northwest Territories]]. To the west, its border with [[British Columbia]] follows the line of peaks of the [[Rocky Mountains]] range along the [[Continental Divide]], which runs northwesterly until it reaches 120° W, at which point the border follows this meridian to 60°N.

With the exception of the southeastern section, the province is well watered. Alberta contains dozens of rivers and lakes ideal for [[swimming]], [[water skiing]], [[fishing]] and a full range of other [[water sports]]. There are a multitude of fresh-water lakes, each less than 260&amp;nbsp;km² situated in Alberta, and three of more considerable size.  These three larger lakes are [[Lake Athabasca]] (7898&amp;nbsp;km²), part of which lies in the province of Saskatchewan, [[Lake Claire (Albertan lake)|Lake Claire]] (1436&amp;nbsp;km²), which lies just west of Lake Athabasca in [[Wood Bufflao National Park]], and [[Lesser Slave Lake]] (1168&amp;nbsp;km²), which is well northwest of [[Edmonton]].

As Alberta extends for 1200&amp;nbsp;km from north to south, and about 600&amp;nbsp;km wide at its greatest east-west extent, it is natural that the climate should vary considerably between the 49th and 60th  parallels. It is also further influenced by altitude, especially in the southwestern part of the province within the [[Canadian Rockies]] and adjacent areas directly to the east.

[[Image:Canada 35 bg 061904.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Banff National Park]]

Northern Alberta is mostly covered by [[taiga|boreal forest]] and has fewer frost-free days than southern Alberta, which is often semi-arid due to the summer heat and much lower rainfall. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains, and enjoys the warmth brought by winter [[chinook wind]]s, while southeastern Alberta is flat, dry prairie, where temperatures can range from very cold (&amp;minus;35°C (&amp;minus;31°F) in the winter) to very hot (35°C (95°F) or higher in the summer). Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely [[aspen parkland]], a [[biome]] transitional between [[prairie]] to the south and [[taiga|boreal forest]] to the north. After southern [[Ontario]], Central Alberta is the most likely region in [[Canada]] to experience [[tornadoe]]s. [[Thunderstorm]]s, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is notable for having the highest frequency of [[hail]] in Canada. 

Overall, Alberta has cold winters, with a daytime average of about &amp;minus;10°C (14°F) in the south to &amp;minus;24°C (&amp;minus;12°F) in the north. In the summer, the daytime temperature averages from about 13°C (55°F) in the Rocky Mountains to 19°C (67°F) in the dry prairie to the south-east. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures.

Alberta's capital city, [[Edmonton]], is located almost in the geographic centre of the province, and most of Alberta's oil is [[refinery|refined]] here. Southern Alberta, where [[Calgary]] is located, is known for its [[ranching]]. Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to [[dairy farming]], with ranching predominantly a southern Alberta industry.  

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Dinosaurparkalberta.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Badlands]] terrain at the Dinosaur Provincial Park]] --&gt;
In southeastern Alberta, where the [[Red Deer River]] traverses the flat prairie and farmland, are the Alberta [[badlands]] with deep [[gorge|gorges]] and striking landforms. [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]], near [[Drumheller, Alberta]], showcases the badlands terrain, [[desert]] [[flora (plants)|flora]], and remnants from Alberta's past when [[dinosaurs]] roamed the then lush landscape.

Alberta is one of only two Canadian provinces to have no maritime coast (the other being the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan.)

==Industry==
:''Main article: [[Industry in Alberta]]''

Alberta is the largest producer of [[petroleum|conventional crude oil]], [[synthetic crude]], [[natural gas]] and gas products in the country.  Two of the largest producers of [[petrochemicals]] in [[North America]] are located in central and north central Alberta.  In both [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], world class [[polyethylene]] and [[vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical]] industry to the east of Edmonton.

The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (previously known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands|Tar Sands]]) have estimated [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves in excess of that of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6 trillion barrels (254 km³).  With the advancement of extraction methods, bitumen and economical synthetic crude are produced at costs nearing that of conventional crude.  This technology is Alberta grown and developed.  Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the Athabasca deposit.  With current technology, only 315 billion barrels (50 km³) are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's youngest and liveliest cities, has grown up entirely because of the large [[multinational corporation]]s which have taken on the task of oil production.

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the Tar Sands is the price of oil.  In 2005, record oil prices have made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.

While [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] is considered the pipeline junction, manufacturing, chemical processing, research and refining centre of the province, [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] is known for its senior and junior oil company head offices (unlike Edmonton, Calgary is not close to any large sources of oil).

With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably the invention and perfection of [[liquid crystal display]] systems.  With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with several civil and private funds.

==Agriculture and forestry==
  
[[Image:Alberta red farm buildings.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Farm Buildings]]
[[Image:Field 150.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Alberta canola field]]
[[Image:Grain Elevator 047.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Grain Elevator - Alberta]]
[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy.  Over 5 million [[cattle]] are residents of the province at one time or another, and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta.  Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[mutton]] are also [[sheep farm|raised]].

[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other [[cereal|grain]]s also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation.  Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion.  Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.

Alberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid]] [[canola]] also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.

The vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]] and [[plywood]], and several northern Alberta plants supply [[North America]] and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].

==Government==
:''See also:  [[Politics of Alberta]]''

[[Edmonton]] is the seat of government of Alberta. It is a [[parliamentary]] [[democracy]]. Its [[unicameral]] legislature  -- the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]] -- consists of 83 members. As Canada's head of state, Queen Elizabeth II is the Government of Alberta's chief executive.  Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor, Norman Kwong.  The government is headed by the [[Premier]], [[Ralph Klein]].  The city of [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] is Alberta's government capital.

The province's revenue comes mainly from the taxation of oil, natural gas, beef, softwood lumber, and wheat, but also includes [[grant]]s from the [[federal government]] primarily for [[infrastructure]] projects.  Albertans are the lowest-[[tax]]ed people in [[Canada]], and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial [[sales tax]] (though residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the [[GST]]). Alberta's municipalities have their own governments which (usually) work in co-operation with the provincial government.

Alberta's [[politics]] are much more conservative than those of other Canadian provinces.  Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the [[Alberta Progressive Conservatives|Progressive Conservatives]] (&quot;Conservatives&quot; or &quot;Tories&quot;), the centrist [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]], and the social democratic [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]]. A fourth party, the strongly conservative [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]], was a power in Alberta for many [[decade]]s, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in the early [[1970s]]. Since that time, no other political party has governed Alberta.  In fact, only  three parties have governed Alberta: the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] the Social Credit Party, and the currently-governing Progressive Conservative Party  

As is the case with many western Canadian provinces, Alberta has had occasional bouts of separatist sentiment. Even during the [[1980|1980s]], when these feelings were at their strongest, there has never been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movements or referenda. There are a number of groups wishing to promote the independence of Alberta in some form currently active in the province. See also: [[Alberta separatism]].

In the [[Alberta general election, 2004|2004 provincial election]], held in November, the [[Alberta Alliance Party]], running to the [[right-wing politics|right]] of the Conservatives, won one seat.

==Education==
As with any Canadian province, the Alberta government is the highest authority in education, creating and regulating the school boards, public colleges, universities, and other educational institutions.

===K-12===
The vast majority of Alberta's schools are run by publicly funded school boards (each with its own district of authority).  The largest are English language Public school boards.  Alberta also has English Separate Catholic boards throughout the province, which serve a substantial minority of students.  There is one protestant school board in part of the province.  Where numbers warrant, there are francophone school boards (Public and Separate Catholic).  All five of these types of boards are  primarily publicly funded (basic school fees range from $200-$750 depending on the school board) by local property taxes and provincial grants given on an equal per student basis by the province (with some adjustments).  The different types of school boards are a necessity under the Canadian constitution, which guarantees the francophones and Catholic communities both the right to their own schools, and the right to administer them.  

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Myhallway.jpg|thumb|210px|right|School Hallway]] --&gt;

Some other Canadian provinces have reformed their school systems on non-religious lines, by seeking a constitutional amendment, but Alberta has not.  Often the decision to go to one system or another is not based on religion, but a parent's belief of which system provides a better education.

Starting in 1994, the province has allowed some [[Alberta charter schools|chartered schools]] to operate, independently of any district school board, reporting directly to the province.  Homeschooling is officially recognized and partially funded from within the Alberta school system.

Originally in Alberta, school boards had the power to levy property taxes within their respective districts. However, this meant districts with a low tax base were underfunded, so the province moved to a system that pools the education property tax, and distributes it based on student population and need.

===Post-secondary===
Alberta's oldest and largest university is Edmonton's [[University of Alberta]]. The [[University of Calgary]], once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966, and is now the second largest university in Alberta.  There is also [[Athabasca University]], which focuses on distance learning, and the [[University of Lethbridge]].  There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology|NAIT]] and [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology|SAIT]] ([http://www.advancededucation.gov.ab.ca/college/postsecsystem/postsecinst/postsecinst.asp]).  Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions.

==Transportation==
Alberta has over 180,000&amp;nbsp;km of [[highway]]s and roads, of which nearly 50,000&amp;nbsp;km are paved. The main north-south [[corridor]] is [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]], which begins south of [[Cardston, Alberta|Cardston]] at the [[Carway, Alberta|Carway]] [[border]] crossing. Highway 4, which effectively extends [[Interstate 15|U.S. Interstate Highway 15]] into Alberta and is the busiest U.S. gateway to the province, begins at the [[Coutts, Alberta|Coutts]] border crossing and ends at [[Lethbridge, Alberta|Lethbridge]]. [[Alberta Highway 3|Highway 3]] joins Lethbridge to [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Fort Macleod]] and links Highway 4 to Highway 2. Highway 2 travels northward through Fort Macleod, [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]], [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] before dividing into two highways. One continues northwest as Highway 43 into [[Grande Prairie, Alberta|Grande Prairie]] and the [[Peace River country]]; the other (Highway 63) travels northeast to [[Fort McMurray]], the location of the [[Athabasca Tar Sands|Athabasca Oil Sands]].  Highway 2 is supplimented by two more highways that run parallel to it: highway 22, west of highway 2, known as 'the cowboy trail', and highway 21, east of highway 2.

Alberta has two main east-west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway|Trans-Canada Highway]] system, enters the province near [[Medicine Hat, Alberta|Medicine Hat]], runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through [[Banff National Park]].  The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network but known alternatively as the [[Yellowhead Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 16|Highway 16]]), runs west from [[Lloydminster, Alberta/Saskatchewan|Lloydminster]] in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and [[Jasper National Park]] into [[British Columbia]]. On a sunny spring or fall day, one of the most scenic drives in the world is along the [[Icefields Parkway]], which runs some 300&amp;nbsp;km between Jasper and Banff, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length.

Urban stretches of Alberta's major highways and [[freeway]]s are often called ''trails''.  For example, Highway 2 is Deerfoot Trail as it passes through Calgary, Calgary Trail as it leaves Edmonton southbound, and St. Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton northbound toward the city of [[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]].  Visitors from outside Alberta often find this disconcerting, accustomed as they are to the notion that a trail is an unpaved route primarily for [[pedestrian]]s.

Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial mass transit systems.  Edmonton and Calgary also operate light rail vehicles.

Alberta is well-connected by air, with international [[airport]]s at both Edmonton and Calgary. Calgary's airport is the larger of the two, and is also the fourth busiest in Canada. It is a hub airport for a significant proportion of the connecting trans-border and international flights into and out of central Canada. There are over 9000&amp;nbsp;km of operating mainline railway, and many tourists see Alberta aboard [[Via Rail]] or [[Rocky Mountain Railtours]].

==Culture==
:''Main article: [[Culture of Alberta]]''

Alberta is well known for its warm and outgoing friendliness and [[frontier]] spirit.  

[[Image:whyte4.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Whyte Avenue, Edmonton]]

Summer brings many festivals to the province.  Edmonton's Fringe Festival is the world's second largest after [[Edinburgh]]'s. Alberta also hosts some of Canada's largest folk festivals, multicultural festivals, and heritage days (to name a few). Calgary is also home to [[Carifest]], the second largest [[Caribbean]] festival in the nation (after [[Caribana]] in [[Toronto]]). These events highlight the province's cultural diversity and love of entertainment.  Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmonton's Arts Barns and the [[Francis Winspear Centre]]. 

Alberta also has a large ethnic population. Both the Chinese and East Indian communities are significant. According to [[Statistics Canada]], Alberta is home to the second highest proportion (two percent) of Francophones in western Canada (after [[Manitoba]]). Many of Alberta's French-speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province. As reported in the 2001 census, the [[China|Chinese]] represented nearly four percent of Alberta's population and [[India|East Indians]] represented better than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have [[Chinatown]]s and Calgary's is Canada's third largest. [[Aboriginal peoples in Alberta|Aboriginal Albertans]] make up approximately three percent of the population. 

The major contributors to Alberta's ethnic diversity have been the European nations. Forty-four percent of Albertans are of [[Great Britain|British]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, and there are also large numbers of [[Germany|Germans]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainians]], and [[Scandinavia]]ns.

Both cities heavily support first-class [[Canadian Football League]] and [[National Hockey League]] teams. [[football (soccer)|Soccer]], [[rugby union]] and [[lacrosse]] are also played professionally in Alberta. 

[[Tourism]] is also important to Albertans. A million visitors come to Alberta each year just for Calgary's world-famous [[Calgary Stampede | Stampede]] and for Edmonton's [[Klondike Days]]. Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the [[Yukon]] [[gold field]]s, and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous [[Chilkoot Pass]].

[[Image:Stephen_Avenue.jpg |thumb|left|Stephen Avenue, Calgary]]

Visitors throng to Calgary for ten days every July for a taste of &quot;Stampede Fever&quot;. As a celebration of Canada's own [[Wild West]] and the cattle ranching industry, the [[Calgary Stampede | Stampede]] welcomes around 1.2 million people each year. Only an hour's drive from the [[Rocky Mountains]], Calgary also makes a visit to tourist attractions like [[Banff National Park]] something which can easily be done in a day. Calgary and Banff each host nearly 5 million tourists yearly.

Alberta is an important destination for tourists who love to [[skiing|ski]] and [[hiking|hike]]; Alberta boasts several world-class [[ski resort]]s. Hunters and fishermen from around the world are able to take home impressive [[trophy|trophies]] and [[tall tales]] from their experiences in Alberta's wilderness.

==Demographics==
Alberta has enjoyed a relatively high rate of growth in recent years, due in large part to its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province saw high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as [[British Columbia]]), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces [http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo33c.htm]. As of 2005, the population of the province was 3,212,813 (''Albertans''). 81% of this population lives in urban areas and 19% is rural. The [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is the most urbanized area in the province and one of the densest in Canada. Many of Alberta's cities and towns have also experienced very high rates of growth in recent history.

Racially and ethnically, the province is predominantly [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]. 88.8% of the population is either white or [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|Aboriginal]] (Aboriginals represent a fairly small proportion of this percentage, however). This number is significantly smaller in many of the cities, particularly [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] which are home to a much larger number of visible minorities.

'''Visible Minorities'''
*3.3% [[China|Chinese]]
*2.3% [[Asian]]
*1.1% [[Black]]
*1.1% [[Filipino people|Filipino]]

Most Albertans identify as [[Christian]]s. Nevertheless, many people in the province observe other faiths or do not profess to a religion at all. Alberta has a somewhat higher percentage of [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians than do other provinces.  Conversely, Alberta also has the second highest percentage of [[Non-religious]] residents in Canada (after British Columbia).

The [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]] of Alberta reside primarily in the extreme south of the province. There are [[Temple (Mormonism)|temples]] in both Cardston and Edmonton. Many Alberta Mormons descend from [[Mormon pioneers]] who emigrated from [[Utah]] around the turn of the 20th century. Alberta also has a large [[Hutterite]] population, a communal  [[Anabaptist]] sect similar to the [[Mennonites]], and a significant population of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] in and around the [[Lacombe]] area due to the presence of the [[Canadian University College]].

Many people of the [[Hindu]], [[Sikh]], and [[Muslim]] faiths also make Alberta their home; one of the largest [[Gurdwara|Sikh temples]] in Canada is located just outside of Edmonton.

'''Religion'''
*[[Protestant]]: 38.9%
*[[Roman Catholic]]: 26.7%
*[[Non-religious|No Affiliation]]: 23.6%

*Buddhist: 1.1%

==History==
:''Main article: [[History of Alberta]]''

The present province of Alberta, as far north as about 53° north latitude, was a part of [[Rupert's Land]] from the time of the incorporation of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] ([[1670]]).  After the arrival in the North-West of the French around 1731 they settled the prairies of the west, establishing communities such as Lac La Biche and Bonnyville. Fort La Jonquière was established near what is now Calgary in (1752).  The [[North-West Company]] of Montreal occupied the northern part of Alberta territory before the Hudson's Bay Company arrived from Hudson Bay to take possession of it.  The first explorer of the Athabasca region was [[Peter Pond]], who, on behalf of the North-West Company of Montreal, built [[Fort Athabasca]] on [[Lac La Biche, Alberta|Lac La Biche]] in 1778.  [[Roderick Mackenzie]] built [[Fort Chipewyan]] on [[Lake Athabasca]] ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] followed the [[North Saskatchewan River]] to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the [[Athabasca River]], which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name -- the [[Mackenzie River]] -- which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to [[Lake Athabasca]], he followed the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] upstream, eventually reaching the [[Pacific Ocean]], and so being the first white man to cross the North American continent north of [[Mexico]].

The district of Alberta was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905 the district of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status.

==Fauna and flora==
===Fauna===
The three climatic regions ([[alpine]], [[forest]], and [[prairie]]) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals.  The south and central prairie was the land of the bison, its grasses providing a great pasture and breeding ground for millions of [[American Bison|buffalo]]. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a strong comeback, and thrive on farms and in parks all over Alberta.

Alberta is home to many large [[carnivore]]s. Among them are the [[Grizzly bear|grizzly]] and [[american Black Bear|black bears]], which are found in the mountains and wooded regions.  Smaller carnivores of the [[dog]] and [[Felidae|cat]] families include [[coyote]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]], [[lynx]], [[bobcat]] and [[mountain lion]] (cougar).  

[[Image:Bighorn23.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Rocky Mountains]] Bighorn Sheep]]

[[Herbivorous]], or plant-eating animals, are found throughout the province. [[Moose]] and [[deer]] (both mule and white-tail [[variety (biology)|varieties]]) are found in the wooded regions, and [[pronghorn antelope]] can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta.  [[Bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s live in the Rocky Mountains.  [[Rabbit]]s,  [[porcupine]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[squirrel]]s, and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is fortunate in that it is home to only one variety of venomous snake, the prairie [[rattlesnake]]. 

Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting-ground of the migratory birds.  Vast numbers of [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s, and [[pelican]]s arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. [[Eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s, and [[crow]]s are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found.  Alberta, like other [[temperate]] regions, is home to [[mosquito]]es, [[fly|flies]], [[wasp]]s, and [[bee]]s.  Rivers and lakes are well stocked with [[pike (fish)|pike]], [[walleye]], [[white fish]], [[Rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Brook trout|speckled]], and [[Brown trout|brown]] [[trout]], and even [[sturgeon]].  [[Turtle]]s are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province.  [[Frog]]s and [[salamander]]s are a few of the [[amphibian]]s that make their homes in Alberta.

===Flora===
In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring brings the prairie anemone, the [[avens]], [[crocus]]es, and other early flowers.  The advancing summer introduces many flowers of the [[sunflower]] family, until in August the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple.  The southern part of Alberta is covered by a short grass, very nutritive, but dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the [[buffalo bean]], [[fleabane]], and [[sage]].  Both yellow and purple [[clover]] fill the roadways and the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents. The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides.  These are largely [[deciduous]], typically [[birch]], [[poplar]], and [[tamarack]]. Many species of [[willow]] and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain.  On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometres.  [[aspen|Aspen poplar]], [[balsam poplar]] (or [[cottonwood]]), and [[paper birch]] are the primary large deciduous species.  [[Conifer]]s include [[Jack pine]], Rocky Mountain pine, [[Lodgepole pine]], both white and black [[spruce]], and the deciduous conifer [[tamarack]].

[[Image:ARCTIC CIRCLE 021106.jpg|thumb|350px]]

[[Image:Arctic Circle sign.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A sign along the [[Dalton Highway]] marking the location of the Arctic Circle]]

The '''Arctic Circle''' is one of the five major [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]] that mark maps of the [[Earth]]. This is the parallel of [[latitude]] that (in 2000) runs [[degree (angle)|66° 33' 39&quot;]] north of the [[Equator]]. Everything north of this circle is known as the [[Arctic]], and the zone just to the south of this circle is the [[temperate|Northern Temperate Zone]]. 

The Arctic Circle marks the southern extremity of the [[polar day]] of the [[summer solstice]] in June and the [[polar night]] of the [[winter solstice]] in December. Within the Arctic Circle, the arctic [[Sun]] is above the [[horizon]] for at least 24 continuous [[hour]]s once per [[year]], in conjunction with the Arctic's [[Summer Solstice]] - this is often referred to in local [[wiktionary:Vernacular|vernacular]] as [[midnight sun]]. Likewise, in conjunction with the Arctic's [[Winter Solstice]], the Arctic sun will be below the horizon for at least 24 continuous hours.
(In fact, because of [[refraction]] and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point, part of the midnight sun may be seen at the night of the summer solstice up to about 50' (90 km) south of the geometric arctic circle; similarly, at the day of the winter solstice part of the sun may be seen up to about 50' north of the geometric arctic circle. This is true at sea level;  these limits increase with elevation above sea level, however in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the horizon.)

The position of the Arctic Circle is determined by the [[axial tilt]] (angle) of the polar axis of rotation of the Earth on the [[ecliptic]].  This angle is not constant, but has a complex motion determined by many cycles of short to very long periods.  Due to [[nutation]] the tilt oscillates over 9&quot; (about 280 [[metre|m]] on the surface) over a period of 18.6 years.  The main long-term cycle has a period of 41000 years and an amplitude of about 0.68°, or 76 km on the surface.  Currently the tilt is decreasing by about 0.47&quot; per year, so the Arctic Circle is moving north by about 14 m per year.  Also see [[precession]].

Countries which have significant territory within the Arctic Circle are:

* [[Russia]]
* [[Canada]]
* [[Denmark]] ([[Greenland]])
* [[United States of America]] ([[Alaska]])
* [[Norway]]
* [[Sweden]]
* [[Finland]]

The country of [[Iceland]] also has territory within the Arctic Circle, but less than 1 sq km.  This area is on a few small islets, of which only [[Grímsey]] (which lies directly on the Arctic Circle) is inhabited.

An '''assault rifle''' is a type of [[automatic rifle]] generally defined as a [[selective fire]] [[rifle]] or [[carbine]] (depending on the particular [[firearm]]'s size), using intermediate-powered ammunition. They are categorized between the larger and heavier [[light machine gun]] and the weaker [[submachine gun]]. Assault rifles are the standard [[Small arms|small arm]] in most modern [[Army|armies]], having largely replaced or suplemented the larger, more powerful rifles of the past.

The name is a literal translation of the German term ''Sturmgewehr'' or &quot;storm weapon&quot;, first applied to the [[Sturmgewehr 44]], developed during [[World War II]]. It gradually became a popular term for this type of firearm. The term has since been retro-actively applied to earlier weapons with similar traits.

==History==

===1900s to the 1930s: Light automatic rifles using rifle cartridges===
[[Image:Avtomat Fedorova 1916.jpg|right|thumb|]]Federov Avtomat (Russia). The weapon fired the Japanese rifle [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge.]]

''These automatic firearms tended to use used pre-existing rifle cartridges, [[kinetic energy]] ranged between 3,000&amp;ndash;5,000 [[Joule|J]] (2,200&amp;ndash;3,700 foot-pounds), velocites of 750&amp;ndash;900 [[m/s]] (2,460&amp;ndash;2,950 ft/s) and bullets of 9 to 13 [[Gram|g]] (139&amp;ndash;200 grains).''

The first true assault rifle was probably the [[Italy|Italian]]-made [[Cei-Rigotti]], which was developed in the 1890s and finished around 1900, at the beginning of the 20th century; it never entered military service, however. The first service assault rifle was the [[Russia]]n [[Federov Avtomat]] of 1916, chambered for the [[Japan]]ese [[Arisaka]] 6.5 × 50 mm rifle [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]], which was only used in small numbers due to supply problems.

The [[Browning Automatic Rifle]] (BAR) was a [[World War I]]-era weapon that used a full-power round. It was an [[automatic rifle]] by today's definition, and designed for single accurate shots and suppressive automatic fire. The weight of roughly 15 pounds (7 kg) meant that it was rather cumbersome for closer quarters. Later developments added heavier [[Gun barrel|barrels]] and [[bipod]]s that lent it to being used as more like today's light machine gun or [[squad automatic weapon]], though it did help establish the doctrine of use for light selective fire rifles. The BAR was produced in large numbers, widely adopted, and served into the 1960s with the U.S. military and other nations. While it did not use an intermediate cartridge, it was an intermediate weapon between the newly adopted submachine guns and heavier [[machine gun]]s such as the [[Lewis Gun]].

During WWI, a few weaker submachine guns also entered service, such as the [[Villar Perosa]], the [[Berretta 1918]] and the [[MP18]]. These weapons fired rounds based of pistols — [[9 mm Glisenti]] and [[9 mm Bergmann]]. The 9 mm Bergman was based on the [[9 mm Parabellum]], with reduced charge to reduce recoil in the MP18. The developers of the [[Thompson submachine gun]] (also developed during the 1910s) originally intended to use rifle-powered rounds. However, a mechanical system that could handle their power was not found and it ended up using the [[.45 ACP]] cartridge. These firearms are considered part of the [[submachine gun]] class, but were an important part in the development of the assault rifles.

===1930s: Automatic intermediate weapons===

''Some of these automatic and [[semi-automatic]] firearms used new intermediate cartridges; others used pre-existing rounds.''

An attempt to provide soldiers with a rifle with intermediate-power ammunition that was heavier than a [[submachine gun]] (too weak, with short range due to the [[pistol]] ammunition), but lighter than a long rifle (uncomfortable to fire, and difficult to control on [[fully-automatic]] mode due to the powerful ammunition; more expensive to design and manufacture), by the [[Italy|Italian]] arms company [[Beretta]] resulted in the MAB 38 (''Moschetto Automatico Beretta 1938''). The MAB 38 used a [[Fiocchi]] ''9M38'' cartridge and a higher-powered 9 mm Parabellum cartridge, which could provide longer range fire. The effective range was about 200 m, although it was declared to be effective up to 500 m. The MAB 38 was a multipurpose weapon.

[[Image:M1 Carbine.jpg|thumb|[[M1 Carbine]] (U.S.). Unlike the M1, the later M2 and M3 were [[Automatic fire|fully-automatic]]]]

In 1938, prior to World War II, the United States introduced the [[M1 Carbine]], which was an intermediate power weapon chambered for the [[.30 Carbine]] cartridge. The M1 Carbine was originally planned to have automatic fire, but this was dropped from the first version, although later in the war, selective fire variants were made (M2 and M3 Carbines). The weapon had higher [[stopping power]] than [[submachine gun]]s, but was not as powerful as full-size automatic rifles such as the BAR. The longer barrel (18-inch) provided the carbine with higher [[muzzle velocity]] than pistols and submachine guns chambered for the same .30 round.

The M1 Carbine series was designed for close quarters engagements, a concept that would be re-applied later. It marked the first time in which such an intermediate weapon would be mass-produced in such large numbers &amp;mdash; it became the most produced American weapon of the war, with millions made. The M1 Carbine series would remain in service with the U.S. military until replaced by the [[M16 (rifle)|M16 rifle]] in the 1960s; it continued to be used in other nations.

===1940s and 1950s: Maschinenkarabiner, Sturmgewehr, &amp; the AK-47===
[[Image:Sturmgewehr 44.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sturmgewehr 44]] (Germany). Its development began in earnest with the Maschinenkarabiner project]]

''Some of these automatic firearms used pre-existing rounds; others used new intermediate cartridges. Kinetic energy ranged between 1,400&amp;ndash;2,100 J (1,033&amp;ndash;1,550 foot-pounds), muzzle velocities of 600&amp;ndash;800m/s (1,970&amp;ndash;2,625 ft/s) and bullets of 7&amp;ndash;9g (108&amp;ndash;139 grains).''

Germany, like other countries, had studied the problem since [[World War I]], and their factories made a variety of non-standard cartridges, therefore having less incentive to retain their existing calibers. The 7.92 × 30 mm cartridge was an example of these experiments; in 1941, it was improved to [[7.92 x 33 mm|7.92 × 33 mm]] ''Infanterie Kurz Patrone'' (&quot;Infantry Short Standard&quot;). In 1942, it was again improved as ''Maschinenkarabiner Patrone S'', and in 1943, ''Pistolen Patrone 43mE''; then, finally, ''Infanterie Kurz Patrone 43''. It is just a coincidence, but the intermediate cartridge developed by Winchester for the M1 Carbine, developed slightly before, also measured 33 mm.

In 1942, [[Walther]] presented the ''Maschinenkarabiner'' (&quot;automatic carbine&quot;, abbr. MKb), named MKb42(W). In the same year, [[Haenel]] presented the MKb42(H), designed by [[Hugo Schmeisser]] as a result of this program. Rheinmetall-Borsig (some said Krieghoff) presented its [[FG 42]] (''Fallschirmjaeger Gewehr 42'', sponsored by [[Hermann Göring]]) though this was in a different role, and using a heavy [[8 mm Mauser|8 × 57 mm]] (8 mm Mauser) cartridge, which was not an intermediate round. War-time tests in [[Russia]] indicated the MKb42(H) performed better than the other two. Schmeisser developed it first as the MP43, then MP43/1, and finally as the MP44/Sturmgewehr 44 (abbreviated StG44). It immediately entered large scale production. More than 5,000 units had been produced by February 1944, and 55,000 by the following November.

Following the end of the war, the [[Soviet Union]] developed the [[AK-47]], which was vaguely similar in concept and layout to the German StG44, but extremely different mechanically. It fired the [[7.62 x 39 mm|7.62 × 39 mm]] cartridge, which had been developed during WWII. The round was similar to the StG44's in that the bullet was of a similar caliber to the Russian rifle ammunition.

===1960s and 1970s: Lighter automatic weapons and lighter smaller bullets===

''Many of these automatic firearms used intermediate cartridges with much lighter bullets and smaller calibers, but fired at very high velocity, kinetic energy ranged between 1300&amp;ndash;1800J (960&amp;ndash;1,330 foot-pounds),  velocities of 900&amp;ndash;1050m/s (2,950&amp;ndash;3,450 ft/s), and bullets of 3&amp;ndash;4g (46&amp;ndash;62 grains).''

[[Image:Stgw 90.jpg|thumb|right|[[SIG 550]] ([[Switzerland|Swiss]]). The SIG fires [[Gw Pat.90]], which has the same caliber as the [[5.56 mm NATO]]]]

Many nations continued the development of traditional high-powered rifles with ranges of 500 meters (550 yards) and beyond. Most designs of this period used low-caliber but high-velocity ammunition, with some experiments in [[flechette]]s and other exotic ammunition.

Statistical studies of World War II battles performed by the [[U.S. Army]] revealed that infantry combat beyond 300 meters (325 yards) was rare. The Russians saw no reason to make a rifle that shot beyond a rifleman's ability to aim. Therefore, a lighter, less-powerful cartridge could be effective. This permitted a lighter rifle and enabled troops to carry more ammunition, making them more autonomous &amp;mdash; a greater amount of the lighter ammunition could be transported in the same amount of space. In addition, the smaller size and handiness of an assault rifle would benefit [[tank]] crews, support troops, and units with missions other than [[front line]] combat. The [[5.56 x 45 mm NATO|5.56 × 45 mm NATO]] cartridge was developed in the 1960s, and was adopted for use in the [[M16 (rifle)|M16]] assault rifle. The M16A1 version soon followed, and was then replaced in 1982 by the M16A2.

The [[Soviet Union]] also developed its own similar round, the [[5.45 x 39 mm|5.45 × 39 mm]], which was used in the [[AK-74]], the successor of the [[AK-47]]. 

These rounds are usually considered less lethal than the previous generation of assault rifle rounds that fired larger rifle caliber ammunition with reduced propellant, but the smaller caliber and lighter bullets achieve higher velocities than even a hunting rifle bullet. These high speeds induce additional lethality through bullet shattering, although these high speed rounds generally do not exceed the momentum of the heavier (but slower) bullets of the less sophisticated AK-47. Any pointed (spitzer) round will tumble in soft tissue. If the jacket has a cannelure like the U.S. 5.56 × 45 mm M193 round, the bullet will fragment, leading to significant blood loss and internal damage. 

Blood loss leads to indirect incapacitation, but often takes longer than direct destruction of tissue. Since combat use of rifles expends around 50,000 rounds in suppressive fire for each combatant killed, trading lighter cartridge weight and lower recoil for slower but more sure incapacitation often makes good sense.

The key to the assault rifle concept is firing at both known ''and suspected'' enemy positions. This allows an attacking infantry unit to shoot at a hidden enemy first, rather than waiting for the enemy to fire first. Good volume and distribution of aimed suppressive fire delivered by infantry squad members as they maneuver, prevents enemy return fire, and in turn allows the assaulting unit to maneuver through enemy fields of fire faster. Faster maneuver limits the assaulting unit's vulnerability to small arms fire, [[artillery]], [[mortar]]s, or counter-attack. Of course this requires a larger basic ammunition load and steady supply of rifle ammunition.

===1970s, 1980s, 1990s: New form factors and features===

''Many of these automatic firearms usually used the same rounds as in older eras, but focused on using new form factors, materials, and added features like standard [[Telescopic sight|telescopic]] and [[Red dot sight|reflex]] sights.''

[[Image:FAMAS dsc06877.jpg|thumb|[[FAMAS]] ([[France]]). It was adopted in 1978]]

The biggest change since adoption of high velocity rounds of 5 mm caliber and higher, has been designs that have new form factors, sights, electronics, and materials. A number of [[bullpup]] rifles entered service in the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Although bullpup rifles had existed since the 1930s, the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[EM2]] was one of the few bullpup assault rifles prior to this time. Examples of the new trend include the [[FAMAS]], [[Steyr AUG]], and [[SA80]]. They were all bullpup rifles that made heavy use of composites and plastics with ambidextrous controls, and the latter both added a low-power [[telescopic sight]] to the standard service version. The [[SAR-21]], the [[Tavor TAR-21]], and [[QBZ-95]] follow a similar trend as well, with a bullpup configuration and heavy use of composites.

The [[Heckler &amp; Koch G36]], adopted in the late 1990s by [[Spain]] and [[Germany]], is of the traditional configuration, but also has integral telescopic and red dot sights and composite exterior. The [[XM8 rifle]], developed from the G36, had similar features, but also added more electronics such as [[laser]] sight, round counter, and integral [[infrared]] laser and pointers.

The trend in the new designs, and very likely future ones, is towards more integrated features and lighter weight with new materials and configurations. Introduction of a new ammunition would require retooling factories, phasing out conventional ammunition and in general infrastructure change that is considered by many military planners too expensive to undertake.

Some have called for a reintroduction of larger caliber rounds to improve conventional lethality, or an increase in caliber in the 6&amp;ndash;7 mm range, with rifle round velocities and lower mass bullets: a kind of intermediate philosophy between the smaller caliber&amp;ndash;faster modern rounds and the standard caliber–slower rounds of the previous generation. China in the late 1980's introduced a 5.8 × 42 mm round, with an initial velocity of 930 m/s, 4.26 g bullet and 1,842 J of energy, China claims the new round provides superior performace and lethality to the NATO and modern Soviet intermediate rounds. In the United States, [[Remington]] has developed the [[6.8 mm Remington SPC]] cartridge, which is the same overall length at the 5.56 x 45 mm NATO round but fires a bullet the same caliber at the [[.270 Winchester]] hunting cartridge.  Its similar size to the 5.56 × 45 mm means that existing rifles can be converted without an excessive amount of trouble.  Development of a [[G11|4.73 mm]] [[caseless ammunition]] and advanced assault rifle in the 1970&amp;ndash;1980s by Germany was effectively halted by the [[German reunification]] in 1990, and that rifle never entered full production.

==&quot;Assault weapons&quot; vs. Fully-automatic weapons==
Primarily in the [[United States]], the term ''[[assault weapon]]'' is an arbitrary (and politicized) phrase generally used to describe a collection of '''''semi-automatic''''' firearms that have certain features associated with military/police use, such as a folding stock, [[flash suppressor]], [[bayonet]], protruding pistol grip, or the ability to accept a detachable magazine of a capacity larger than ten rounds. The phrase ''assault weapon'' has been used primarily in relation to a specific expired [[gun law]] that was commonly known as the '[[Federal assault weapons ban|Assault Weapons Ban]]', '[[Clinton]] gun ban', or '1994 crime bill'. It is a common misconception that the assault weapons ban restricted weapons capable of fully-automatic fire, such as assault rifles and [[machine gun]]s. Fully-automatic weapons were unaffected by the ban because they have been heavily restricted since the [[National Firearms Act]] of 1934, and other, more recent laws. 

The term 'assault weapon' has often been erroneously used to describe machine guns. Many states and localities still use the term [[assault weapon]] with a variety of variations following the California model loosely. See separate article on [[assault weapon]]s for further information.

'''Animals''' are a major group of [[organism]]s, classified as the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] '''Animalia''' or '''Metazoa'''.  In general they are [[multicellular]], capable of locomotion and responsive to their environment, and feed by consuming other organisms.  Their body plan becomes fixed as they develop, usually early on in their [[ontogeny|development]] as [[embryo]]s, although some undergo a process of [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] later on.  

The name animal comes from the [[Latin]] word ''animal'', of which ''animalia'' is the plural, and ultimately from ''anima'', meaning vital breath or soul.

==Characteristics==
Kingdom Animalia has several characteristics that set it apart from other living things.  Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and [[multicellular]], which separates them from [[bacteria]] and most [[protist]]s.  They are [[Heterotroph|heterotrophic]], generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from [[plant]]s and [[alga]]e.  They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking cell walls.

==Structure==
With a few exceptions, most notably the [[sponge|sponges]] (Phylum Porifera), animals have bodies differentiated into separate [[biological tissue|tissues]]. These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber, with one or two openings. Animals with this sort of organization are called metazoans, or [[eumetazoan]]s when the former is used for animals in general.

All animals have [[eukaryotic]] cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[shell]]s, [[bone]]s, and [[spicule]]s. During development it forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized, making complex structures possible. In contrast, other multicellular organisms like plants and fungi have cells held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth. Also, unique to animal cells are the following intercellular junctions: [[tight junction]]s, [[gap junction]]s, and [[desmosome]]s.

==Reproduction and development==

Nearly all animals undergo some form of [[sexual reproduction]].  Adults are [[diploid]] or occasionally [[polyploid]].  They have a few specialized reproductive cells, which undergo [[meiosis]] to produce smaller motile [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] or larger non-motile [[ovum|ova]].  These fuse to form [[zygote]]s, which develop into new individuals.

Many animals are also capable of [[asexual reproduction]].  This may take place through [[parthenogenesis]], where fertile eggs are produced without mating, or in some cases through fragmentation.

A [[zygote]] initially develops into a hollow sphere, called a [[blastula]], which undergoes rearrangement and differentiation.  In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location and develop into a new sponge.  In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement.  It first [[invagination|invaginates]] to form a [[gastrula]] with a digestive chamber, and two separate [[germ layer]]s - an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm.  In most cases, a mesoderm also develops between them.  These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs.

Animals grow by indirectly using the energy of [[sunlight]].  Plants use this [[energy]] to turn air into simple [[sugars]] using a process known as [[photosynthesis]].  These sugars are then used as the building blocks which allow the plant to grow.  When animals eat these plants (or eat other animals which have eaten plants), the sugars produced by the plant are used by the animal.  They are either used directly to help the animal grow, or broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the animal the energy required for motion.  This process is known as [[glycolysis]].

==Origin and fossil record==

Animals are generally considered to have evolved from [[flagellate]] protozoa.  Their closest living relatives are the [[choanoflagellate]]s, collared flagellates that have the same structure as certain sponge cells do.  Molecular studies place them in a supergroup called the [[opisthokont]]s, which also include the [[fungus|fungi]] and a few small parasitic [[protist]]s.  The name comes from the posterior location of the [[flagellum]] in motile cells, such as most animal sperm, whereas other eukaryotes tend to have anterior flagella.

The first fossils that might represent animals appear towards the end of the [[Precambrian]], around 600 million years ago, and are known as the [[Vendian biota]].  These are difficult to relate to later fossils, however.  Some may represent precursors of modern phyla, but they may be separate groups, and it is possible they are not really animals at all.  Aside from them, most known animal phyla make a more or less simultaneous appearance during the [[Cambrian]] period, about 570 million years ago.  It is still disputed whether this event, called the [[Cambrian explosion]], represents a rapid divergence between different groups or a change in conditions that made fossilization possible.

==Groups of animals==
[[Image:Elephant-ear-sponge.jpg|thumb|left|Elephant ear [[sponge]]]]
The sponges ([[Porifera]]) diverged from other animals early.  As mentioned, they lack the complex organization found in most other phyla.  Their cells are differentiated, but not organized into distinct tissues.  Sponges are sessile and typically feed by drawing in water through [[pore]]s. [[Archaeocyatha]], which have fused skeletons, may represent sponges or a separate phylum.

[[Image:Brain_coral.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brain Coral]]]]
Among the eumetazoan phyla, two are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening, which serves as both the mouth and the anus.  These are the [[Cnidaria]], which include [[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, and [[jellyfish]], and the [[Ctenophora]] or comb jellies.  Both have distinct tissues, but they are not organized into [[organ (anatomy)|organs]].  There are only two main germ layers, the ectoderm and endoderm, with only scattered cells between them.  As such, these animals are sometimes called [[diploblastic]].  The tiny phylum [[Placozoa]] is similar, but individuals do not have a permanent digestive chamber.

The remaining animals form a monophyletic group called the [[Bilateria]].  For the most part, they are bilaterally symmetric, and often have a specialized head with feeding and sensory organs.  The body is [[triploblastic]], i.e. all three germ layers are well-developed, and tissues form distinct organs.  The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and there is also an internal body cavity called a coelom or pseudocoelom.  There are exceptions to each of these characteristics, however - for instance adult [[echinoderm]]s are radially symmetric, and certain parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures.

[[Image:Common_clownfish.jpg|thumb|right|[[Clownfish]] in their [[Sea Anemone]] home]]
Genetic studies have considerably changed our understanding of the relationships within the Bilateria.  Most appear to belong to four major lineages:
# [[Deuterostomes]]
# [[Ecdysozoa]]
# [[Platyzoa]]
# [[Lophotrochozoa]]

In addition to these, there are a few small groups of bilaterians with relatively similar structure that appear to have diverged before these major groups.  These include the [[Acoelomorpha]], [[Rhombozoa]], and [[Orthonectida]].  The [[Myxozoa]], single-celled parasites that were originally considered Protozoa, are now believed to have developed from the Bilateria as well.

[[Image:Magellanic-penguin02.jpg|thumb|left|the [[Magellanic Penguin]]]]
===Deuterostomes===
[[Deuterostome]]s differ from the other Bilateria, called [[protostome]]s, in several ways.  In both cases there is a complete digestive tract.  However, in protostomes the initial opening (the [[archenteron]]) develops into the mouth, and an anus forms separately.  In deuterostomes this is reversed.  In most protostomes cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm, called schizocoelous development, but in deuterostomes it forms through [[invagination]] of the endoderm, called enterocoelic pouching.  Deuterostomes also have a dorsal, rather than a ventral, nerve chord and their embryos undergo different cleavage.

All this suggests the deuterostomes and protostomes are separate, monophyletic lineages.  The main phyla of deuterostomes are the [[Echinodermata]] and [[Chordate|Chordata]].  The former are radially symmetric and exclusively marine, such as [[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea cucumber]]s.  The latter are dominated by the [[vertebrate]]s, animals with backbones.  These include [[fish]], [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s.

In addition to these, the deuterostomes also include the [[Hemichordata]] or acorn worms.  Although they are not especially prominent today, the important fossil [[graptolite]]s may belong to this group.  The [[Chaetognatha]] or arrow worms may also be deuterostomes, but this is less certain.

===Ecdysozoa===
[[Image:Sympetrum flaveolum - side (aka).jpg|thumb|the [[Yellow-winged Darter]]]]
The [[Ecdysozoa]] are protostomes, named after the common trait of growth by moulting or [[ecdysis]].  The largest animal phylum belongs here, the [[Arthropoda]], including [[insect]]s, [[spider]]s, [[crab]]s, and their kin.  All these organisms have a body divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages.  Two smaller phyla, the [[Onychophora]] and [[Tardigrada]], are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits.

[[Image:roundworm.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roundworm]]]]
The ecdysozoans also include the [[Nematoda]] or roundworms, the second largest animal phylum.  Roundworms are typically microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is water.  A number are important parasites.  Smaller phyla related to them are the [[Nematomorpha]] or horsehair worms, which are visible to the unaided eye, and the [[Kinorhyncha]], [[Priapulida]], and [[Loricifera]], which are all microscopic.  These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom.

The remaining two groups of protostomes are sometimes grouped together as the Spiralia, since in both embryos develop with spiral cleavage.

===Platyzoa===
The [[Platyzoa]] include the phylum [[Platyhelminthes]], the flatworms.  These were originally considered some of the most primitive Bilateria, but it now appears they developed from more complex ancestors.

[[Image:Rotifer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rotifer]]]]
A number of parasites are included in this group, such as the [[fluke]]s and [[tapeworm]]s.  Flatworms lack a coelom, as do their closest relatives, the microscopic [[Gastrotricha]].

The other platyzoan phyla are microscopic and pseudocoelomate.  The most prominent are the [[Rotifera]] or rotifers, which are common in aqueous environments.  They also include the [[Acanthocephala]] or spiny-headed worms, the [[Gnathostomulida]], [[Micrognathozoa]], and possibly the [[Cycliophora]].  These groups share the presence of complex jaws, from which they are called the [[Gnathifera]].

===Lophotrochozoa===
[[Image:Reef2063.jpg|thumb|Big Blue [[Octopus]]]]
The [[Lophotrochozoa]] include two of the most successful animal phyla, the [[Mollusca]] and [[Annelida]].  The former includes animals such as [[snail]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[squid]]s, and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as [[earthworm]]s and [[leech]]es.  These two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of [[trochophore]] larvae, but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods, because they are both segmented.  Now this is generally considered convergent evolution, owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla.

The Lophotrochozoa also include the [[Nemertea]] or ribbon worms, the [[Sipuncula]], and several phyla that have a fan of cilia around the mouth, called a [[lophophore]].  These were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates, but it now appears they are [[paraphyletic]], some closer to the Nemertea and some to the Mollusca and Annelida.  They include the [[Brachiopoda]] or lamp shells, which are prominent in the fossil record, the [[Entoprocta]], the [[Phoronida]], and possibly the [[Bryozoa]] or moss animals.

==History of classification==
[[Image:Caerulea3 crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[White's Tree Frog]]]]
[[Image:Rød ræv (Vulpes vulpes).jpg|thumb|''Vulpes vulpes'', the [[red fox]]]]
[[Aristotle]] divided the living world between animals and [[plant]]s, and this was followed by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] in the first hierarchical classification.  Since then biologists have begun emphasizing evolutionary relationships, and so these groups have been restricted somewhat.  For instance, microscopic [[protozoa]] were originally considered animals because they move, but are now treated separately.  

In [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the classes of [[Vermes]], [[Insect]]a, [[Fish|Pisces]], [[Amphibia]], [[bird|Aves]], and [[Mammal]]ia. Since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the [[chordate|Chordata]], whereas the various other forms have been separated out. The above lists represent our current understanding of the group, though there is some variation from source to source.

==Usage of the word ''animal''==
In everyday usage ''animal'' refers to any member of the [[animal kingdom]] that is not a [[human being]], and sometimes excludes [[insects]] (although including such arthropods as crabs). This confusion stems primarily from the familiarity with zoo animals, farm animals and pets, not from an analytical distinction between insects, humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Astronomy and Astrophysics''''' (abbreviated as ''A&amp;A'' in the astronomical literature, or else ''Astron. Astrophys.'') is a European Journal, publishing papers on theoretical, observational and instrumental [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]].  It was published by [[Springer-Verlag]] from [[1969]]-[[2000]], while [[EDP Sciences]] published the companion ''A&amp;A Supplement Series''.  In 2000, the two journals merged, with the combined journal known simply as ''Astronomy and Astrophysics'', and published by EDP Sciences.

''A&amp;A'' is one of the major journals of astronomy, alongside the ''[[Astrophysical Journal]]'', ''[[Astronomical Journal]]'' and the ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]''.  While the first two are often the preferred journal of US-based researchers and the MNRAS is often the favoured journal for UK- and Commonwealth-based astronomers, A&amp;A tends to be the preferred journal of astronomers based in [[Europe]] (excluding the UK), particularly since page charges are waived for astronomers working in member countries.

''A&amp;A'' was created from the merger in 1969 of six major European astronomical journals     
* ''Annales d'Astrophysique'' (France), founded in 1938
* ''Arkiv for Astronomi'' (Sweden), founded in 1948
* ''Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands'', founded in 1921
* ''Bulletin Astronomique'' (France), founded in 1884
* ''Journal des Observateurs'' (France), founded in 1915
* ''Zeitschrift fur Astrophysik'' (Germany), founded in 1930
and extended in 1992 by the incorporation of:
* ''Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of Czechoslovakia'', founded in 1947

The '''Actinopterygii''' are the '''ray-finned [[fish]]'''. They are the dominant group of [[vertebrate]]s, with over 27,000 species ubiquitous throughout [[fresh water]] and [[ocean|marine]] environments.

==Classification==
Traditionally three grades of Actinopterygii have been recognized: the '''[[Chondrostei]]''', '''[[Holostei]]''', and '''[[Teleostei]]'''.  The second is [[paraphyletic]] and tends to be abandoned, however, while the first is now restricted to those forms closer to extant [[Chondrostei]] than to the other groups.  Nearly all fish alive today are teleosts.  A listing of the different groups is given below, down to the level of orders, arranged in what is believed to represent the evolutionary sequence down to the level of superorder.

* '''Subclass [[Chondrostei]]'''
** Order [[Polypteriformes]]  (bichirs)

[[Image:Einstein In Overcoat.jpg|thumb|right|222px|Albert Einstein photographed by Oren J. Turner in 1947.]]

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] – [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] widely regarded as the greatest [[science|scientist]] of the 20th century. He was the author of the [[general theory of relativity]]  and made important contributions to the [[special theory of relativity]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]], and [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. He was awarded the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] in 1905 (his &quot;[[Annus Mirabilis Papers|miracle year]]&quot;) and &quot;for his services to Theoretical Physics.&quot;

After British [[solar eclipse]] expeditions in 1919 confirmed that light rays from distant stars were deflected by the gravity of the sun in the exact amount he predicted in his [[general theory of  relativity]], Einstein became world-famous, an unusual achievement for a scientist. In his later years, his fame exceeded that of any other scientist in [[history of science and technology|history]]. In [[popular culture]], his name has become synonymous with great [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and [[genius]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Young Albert Einstein.jpg|thumb|left|222px|Young Einstein before the Einsteins moved from [[Germany]] to [[Italy]].]]
===Youth and college===
Einstein was born on [[March 14]], [[1879]] at [[Ulm]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[German Empire]], about 100 km east of [[Stuttgart]]. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a featherbed salesman who later ran an [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] works, and Pauline, whose maiden name was Koch. They were married in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt. The family was [[Jew]]ish (non-observant); Albert attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]] and, at the insistence of his mother, was given [[violin]] lessons. Though he initially disliked (and eventually discontinued) the lessons, he would later take great solace in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[violin sonata]]s.

When Albert was five, his [[father]] showed him a pocket [[compass]], and Einstein realized that something in &quot;empty&quot; space acted upon the [[needle]]; he would later describe the experience as one of the most revelatory of his life. Though he built [[model (physical)|model]]s and [[machine|mechanical device]]s for fun and showed great mathematical faculty early on, he was considered a slow learner, possibly due to [[dyslexia]], simple [[shyness]], or the significantly rare and unusual structure of [[Albert Einstein's brain|his brain]] (examined after his death).{{rf|1|brain}} He later credited his development of the theory of relativity to this slowness, saying that by pondering space and time later than most children, he was able to apply a more developed intellect. Some researchers have speculated that Einstein may have exhibited some traits of mild forms of [[autism]], although they concede that a reliable posthumous diagnosis is impossible.{{rf|2|autism}}

In 1889, a student named Max Talmud introduced Einstein to key science and [[philosophy]] texts including [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Two of his uncles would further foster his intellectual interests during his late childhood and early adolescence by suggesting and providing books on science, mathematics and philosophy. 

Einstein attended the [[Luitpold Gymnasium]] where he received a relatively progressive education.  He began to learn [[mathematics]] around age twelve: in 1891, he taught himself [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean plane geometry]] from a school booklet and began to study [[calculus]]. There is a recurring [[rumor]] that he failed mathematics later in his education, but this is untrue; a change in the way grades were assigned caused confusion years later. While there, he clashed with authority and resented the school regimen, believing the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in such an endeavor as strict memorization.    

In 1894, following the failure of Hermann's electrochemical business, the Einsteins moved from [[Munich]] to [[Pavia, Italy]] (near [[Milan]]). Einstein's first scientific work was written therein (called &quot;''The Investigation of the State of [[Aether]] in [[Magnetic Field]]s''&quot;).  Albert remained behind in Munich lodgings to finish school, completing only one term before leaving the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in spring 1895 to rejoin his family in Pavia. He quit without telling his parents and a year and a half prior to final examinations, Einstein convinced the school to let him go with a medical note from a friendly doctor, but this meant he had no secondary-school certificate.{{rf|3|Highfield1}} That year, at the age of 16, he performed the [[thought experiment]] known as Albert Einstein's mirror. After gazing into a mirror, he examined what would happen to his image if he were moving at the [[speed of light]]; his conclusion that the speed of light is independent of the observer would later become one of the two [[postulates of special relativity]].  

Despite excelling in the mathematics and science portion, his failure of the liberal arts portion of the ''[[ETH Zurich|Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule]]'' (ETH, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in [[Zurich]]) entrance exam the following year was a setback; his family sent him to [[Aarau]], [[Switzerland]], to finish secondary school, where he studied the seldom-taught [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell's]] [[classical electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]] and received his diploma in September 1896. During this time he lodged with Professor Jost Winteler's family and became enamoured with Marie, their daughter, his first sweetheart. Albert's sister Maja was to later marry their son Paul, and his friend [[Michele Besso]] married their other daughter Anna.{{rf|4|Highfield2}} Einstein subsequently enrolled at the ''Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule'' in October and moved to Zurich, while Marie moved to [[Olsberg]] for a teaching post. The same year, he renounced his [[Württemberg]] citizenship and became [[stateless person|stateless]].

In the spring of 1896, the [[Serbia]]n [[Mileva Maric|Mileva Marić]] started initially as a medical student at the [[University of Zurich]], but after a term switched to the same section as Einstein as the only woman that year to study for the same diploma. Einstein's relationship with Mileva developed into romance over the next few years.

In 1900, he was granted a teaching diploma by the ''Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule'' ([[ETH Zurich]]). Einstein then wrote his first published paper on the [[capillary action|capillary forces]] of a drinking straw, wherein he tried to unify the [[laws of physics]], an attempt he would continually make throughout his life. (It was titled &quot;''Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen'',&quot; which translated is &quot;''Consequences of the observations of capillarity phenomena'',&quot; found in &quot;''Annalen der Physik''&quot; volume 4, page 513.) Shortly following, Einstein was accepted as a Swiss citizen in 1901; he kept his Swiss passport for his whole life. Through his friend Michelle Besso, an [[engineer]], he was presented with the works of [[Ernst Mach]] and later would consider him &quot;the best sounding board in Europe&quot; for physical ideas. During this time Einstein discussed his scientific interests with a group of close friends, including Besso and Mileva. The men referred to themselves as the &quot;Olympia Academy.&quot; He and Mileva had an illegitimate daughter [[Lieserl Einstein|Lieserl]], born in January 1902.

===Work and doctorate===
[[Image:Einstein patentoffice.jpg|frame|right||Einstein in 1905, when he wrote the &quot;''[[Annus Mirabilis Papers]]''&quot;]]

Upon graduation, Einstein could not find a teaching post, mostly because his brashness as a young man had apparently irritated most of his professors. The father of a classmate helped him obtain employment as a technical assistant [[patent clerk|examiner]] at the Swiss Patent Office{{rf|5|www.ipi.ch.376}} in 1902. There, Einstein judged the worth of [[inventor]]s' [[patent]] applications for devices that required a knowledge of physics to understand — in particular he was chiefly charged to evaluate patents relating to electromagnetic devices.{{rf|6|Galison368}} He also learned how to discern the essence of applications despite sometimes poor descriptions, and was taught by the director how &quot;to express [him]self correctly&quot;. He occasionally rectified their design errors while evaluating the practicality of their work.

Einstein married [[Mileva Marić]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Einstein's marriage to Marić, who was a mathematician, was both a personal and intellectual partnership: Einstein referred to Mileva as &quot;a creature who is my equal and who is as strong and independent as I am&quot;.  [[Ronald W. Clark]], a biographer of Einstein, claimed that Einstein depended on the distance that existed in his and Mileva's marriage in order to have the solitude necessary to accomplish his work; he required intellectual isolation.  [[Abram Joffe]], a Soviet physicist who knew Einstein, in an obituary of Einstein, wrote, &quot;The author of [the papers of 1905] was ... a bureaucrat at the Patent Office in Bern, Einstein-Marić&quot; and this has recently been taken as evidence of a collaborative relationship.  However, according to Alberto A. Martínez of the Center for Einstein Studies at Boston University, Joffe only ascribed authorship to Einstein, as he believed that it was a Swiss custom at the time to append the spouse's last name to the husband's name.{{rf|7|physicsweb.org.377}}  Whatever the truth, the extent of her influence on Einstein's work is a highly controversial and debated question.

On [[May 14]], [[1904]], the couple's first son, [[Hans Albert Einstein]], was born. In 1903, Einstein's position at the [[Swiss Patent Office]] had been made permanent, though he was passed over for promotion until he had &quot;fully mastered machine technology&quot;.{{rf|8|Galison370}} He obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] after submitting his thesis &quot;''A new determination of molecular dimensions''&quot; (&quot;''Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen''&quot;) in 1905.

That same year, he wrote four articles that provided the foundation of modern physics, without much [[scientific literature]] to which he could refer or many scientific colleagues with whom he could discuss the theories. Most physicists agree that three of those papers (on [[Brownian motion]], the [[photoelectric effect]], and [[special relativity]]) deserved [[Nobel Prize]]s. Only the paper on the photoelectric effect would be mentioned by the Nobel committee in the award. This is ironic, not only because Einstein is far better-known for relativity, but also because the photoelectric effect is a quantum phenomenon, and Einstein became somewhat disenchanted with the path [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] would take. In each of these papers, Einstein boldly took an idea from theoretical physics to its logical consequences and managed to explain experimental results that had baffled scientists for decades.

====Annus Mirabilis Papers====
{{details|Annus Mirabilis Papers}}

Einstein submitted the series of papers to the &quot;''Annalen der Physik''&quot;.  They are commonly referred to as the &quot;''[[Annus Mirabilis Papers]]''&quot; (from [[List of Latin phrases|''Annus mirabilis'']], [[Latin]] for 'year of wonders'). The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics ([[IUPAP]]) commemorated the 100th year of the publication of Einstein's extensive work in 1905 as the '[[World Year of Physics 2005]]'.

The first paper, named &quot;''On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light''&quot;, (&quot;''Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt''&quot;) proposed that &quot;energy quanta&quot; (which are essentially what we now call [[photon]]s) were real, and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the [[photoelectric effect]].  This paper was specifically cited for his Nobel Prize. [[Max Planck]] had made the formal assumption that energy was quantized in deriving his black-body radiation law, published in 1901, but had considered this to be no more than a mathematical trick.  The photoelectric effect thus provided a simple confirmation of Max Planck's hypothesis of quanta.

His second article in 1905, named &quot;''On the Motion—Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat—of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid''&quot;, (&quot;''[[Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen]]''&quot;) covered his study of [[Brownian motion]], and provided empirical evidence for the existence of atoms. Before this paper, [[atom]]s were recognized as a useful concept, but [[physicist]]s and [[chemist]]s hotly debated whether atoms were real entities. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave [[experimentalist]]s a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary [[microscope]]. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.  At the same time as Einstein, Brownian Motion was also described by [[Smoluchowski]].

Einstein's third paper that year, &quot;''On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies''&quot; (&quot;''Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper''&quot;), was published in September 1905. This paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], a theory of time, distance, mass and energy which was consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omitted the force of [[gravity]]. While developing this paper, Einstein wrote to Mileva about &quot;our work on relative motion&quot;, and this has led some to ask whether Mileva played a part in its development. A few historians of science believe that Einstein and his wife were both aware that the famous Frenchman [[Henri Poincaré]] had already published the equations of Relativity, a few weeks  before Einstein submitted his paper; most believe their work independent, especially given Einstein's isolation at this time. 

A fourth paper, &quot;''Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?''&quot;, (&quot;''Ist die Trägheit eines Körpers von seinem Energieinhalt abhängig?''&quot;) published late in 1905, showed one further deduction from relativity's [[axiom]]s, the famous equation that the [[energy]] of a body at rest (''E'') equals its mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: ''[[E=mc²|E&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;mc&amp;sup2;]]''. &lt;!-- whether this is correct or should be included seems dubious:  , this equation having been first correctly published by [[Henri Poincaré]] (1900), for the case of mass equivalence of electromagnetic [[radiation]].  Max Planck(1907) questioned the reasoning in Einstein's derivation, and H.E.Ives(1953) called Einstein's derivation a tautology. --&gt;

===Middle years===
[[Image:Einstein 1911 Solvay.jpg|frame|right|Einstein at the 1911 [[Solvay Conference]].]] 

In 1906, Einstein was promoted to technical examiner second class. In 1908, Einstein was licensed in [[Bern]], Switzerland, as a [[Privatdozent]] (unsalaried teacher at a university). Einstein's second son, [[Eduard Einstein|Eduard]], was born on [[July 28]], [[1910]]. At this time, he described why the sky is blue in his paper on the phenomenon of [[critical opalescence]], which shows the cumulative effect of [[scattering]] of light by individual molecules in the atmosphere.[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/genius/] In 1911, Einstein became first associate [[professor]] at the [[University of Zurich]], and shortly afterwards full professor at the (German) [[University of Prague]], only to return the following year to [[Zurich]] in order to become full professor at the [[ETH Zurich]]. At that time, he worked closely with the [[mathematician]] [[Marcel Grossmann]]. In 1912, Einstein started to refer to [[time]] as the [[fourth dimension]] (although [[H.G. Wells]] had done this earlier, in 1895 in ''[[The Time Machine]]'').

In 1914, just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]] as professor at the local [[University of Berlin|university]] and became a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]. He took German citizenship. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jew]]ish origins irritated German nationalists.  After he became world-famous, nationalistic hatred of him grew and for the first time he was the subject of an organized campaign to discredit his theories. From 1914 to 1933, he served as director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time that he was awarded his [[Nobel Prize]] and made his most groundbreaking discoveries. He was also an extraordinary professor at the [[Leiden University]] from 1920 until officially 1946, where he regularly gave guest lectures.

In 1917, Einstein published &quot;''On the Quantum Mechanics of Radiation''&quot; (&quot;''Zur Quantenmechanik der Strahlung''&quot;, Physkalische Zeitschrift 18, 121-128). This article introduced the concept of [[stimulated emission]], the physical principle that allows light amplification in the [[laser]]. He also published a paper that year that used the general theory of relativity to model the behavior of the entire universe, setting the stage for modern [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. In this work he created his self-described &quot;worst blunder&quot;, the [[cosmological constant]].

Einstein divorced Mileva on [[February 14]], [[1919]], and married his cousin [[Elsa Löwenthal]] (born Einstein: Löwenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]]. Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally). She was three years older than Albert, and had nursed him to health after he had suffered a partial nervous breakdown combined with a severe stomach ailment; there were no children from this marriage. The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, Lieserl, is unknown. Some believe she died in infancy, while others believe she was given out for adoption.  They later had two sons: Eduard and Hans Albert. Eduard intended to practice as a [[psychoanalyst|Freudian analyst]] but was institutionalized for [[schizophrenia]] and died in an asylum. [[Hans Albert Einstein|Hans Albert]], his older brother, became a professor of [[hydraulic engineering]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], having little interaction with his father. 
[[Image:Einstein theory triumphs.png|thumb|left|222px|&quot;Einstein theory triumphs,&quot; declared the ''[[New York Times]]'' on [[November 10]] [[1919]].]]

====General relativity====
In November 1915, Einstein presented a series of lectures before the Prussian Academy of Sciences in which he described his theory of gravity, known as [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity, the Field Equation, which was first derived from a variational principle by [[David Hilbert]].  This theory considered all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it is in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]].  

The theory provided the foundation for the study of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were discovered well after Einstein's death.  A truly revolutionary theory, general relativity has so far passed every test posed to it and has become a powerful tool used in the analysis of many subjects in physics.

Initially, scientists were skeptical because the theory was derived by mathematical reasoning and rational analysis, not by experiment or observation.  But in 1919, predictions made using the theory were confirmed by [[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Arthur Eddington]]'s measurements (during a [[solar eclipse]]), of how much the light emanating from a star was [[Gravitational lens|bent]] by the [[Sun]]'s gravity when it passed close to the Sun, an effect called gravitational lensing. The observations were carried out on [[May 29]], [[1919]], at two locations, one in [[Sobral, Ceará]], [[Brazil]], and another in the island of [[Principe]], in the west coast of [[Africa]]. On [[November 7]], ''[[The Times]]'' reported the confirmation, cementing Einstein's fame.  

Many scientists were still unconvinced for various reasons ranging from disagreement with Einstein's interpretation of the experiments, to not being able to tolerate the absence of an absolute frame of reference.  In Einstein's view, many of them simply could not understand the mathematics involved.  Einstein's public fame which followed the 1919 article created resentment among these scientists some of which lasted well into the 1930s.

In the early 1920s Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.  On [[March 30]], [[1921]], Einstein went to [[New York City|New York]] to give a lecture on his new Theory of Relativity, the same year he was awarded the Nobel Prize. Though he is now most famous for his work on relativity, it was for his earlier work on the [[photoelectric effect]] that he was given the Prize, as his work on general relativity was still disputed. The Nobel committee decided that citing his less-contested theory in the Prize would gain more acceptance from the scientific community.

Sir Edmund Whittaker(1953) stated that [[David Hilbert]] published the theory of general relativity  ''nearly simultaneously'' with Einstein.

====The &quot;Copenhagen&quot; interpretation====
[[Image:Niels Bohr Albert Einstein by Ehrenfest.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]] sparred over [[quantum theory]] during the 1920s.]]
Einstein's postulation that light can be described not only as a wave with no kinetic energy, but also as massless discrete packets of energy called quanta with measurable kinetic energy (now known as photons) was a landmark break with the classical physics. In 1909 Einstein presented his first paper on the quantification of light to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.

In the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new theory of [[quantum mechanics]], Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behaviour. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for a more &quot;complete&quot; explanation, i.e., more [[scientific determinism|deterministic]]. He could not abandon the belief that physics described the laws that govern &quot;real things&quot;, the belief which had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity.

In a 1926 letter to [[Max Born]], Einstein made a remark that is now famous:
: ''Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.'' 

To this, [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], who sparred with Einstein on quantum theory, retorted, &quot;Stop telling God what He must do!&quot; The [[Bohr-Einstein debates]] on foundational aspects of quantum mechanics happened during the [[Solvay Conference|Solvay conferences]]. 

Einstein was not rejecting probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein himself was a great statistician, using statistical analysis in his works on Brownian motion and photoelectricity and in papers published before the miraculous year 1905; Einstein had even discovered [[Gibbs ensemble]]s. He believed, however, that at the core reality behaved [[scientific determinism|deterministically]]. Many physicists argue that experimental evidence contradicting this belief was found much later with the discovery of [[Bell's Theorem]] and [[Bell's inequality]]. Nonetheless, there is still space for lively discussions about the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]].

====Bose-Einstein statistics====
In 1924, Einstein received a short paper from a young [[India]]n physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] describing light as a gas of photons and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realized that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in [[German language|German]] (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose-Einstein statistics]] now describe any assembly of these [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] known as [[boson]]s. The [[Bose-Einstein condensate]] phenomenon was predicted in the 1920s by Bose and Einstein, based on Bose's work on the statistical mechanics of photons, which was then formalized and generalized by Einstein. The first such condensate was produced by [[Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] in 1995 at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. Einstein's original sketches on this theory were recovered in August 2005 in the library of [[Leiden University]].{{rf|10|www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl.378}}

Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schrödinger]] in the development of the [[quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model although he realized that this was less significant than the Bose-Einstein model and declined to have his name included on the paper.

====The Einstein refrigerator====
[[Image:Einstein Refrigerator.png|thumb|right|222px|Einstein and [[Leó Szilárd|Szilárd]]'s refrigerator  patent diagram.]]

Einstein and former student [[Leó Szilárd]] co-invented a unique type of [[refrigeration|refrigerator]] (usually called the [[Einstein refrigerator]]) in 1926.{{rf|11|gtalumni.org.379}} On [[November 11]], [[1930]], {{US patent|1,781,541}} was awarded to Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd. The patent covered a thermodynamic refrigeration cycle providing cooling with no moving parts, at a constant [[pressure]], with only [[heat]] as an input. The refrigeration cycle used [[ammonia]], [[butane]], and [[water (molecule)|water]].

====World War II====
When [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in January 1933, Einstein was a guest professor at [[Princeton University]], a position which he took in December 1932, after a invitation from the American educator, [[Abraham Flexner]]. In 1933, the [[Nazi]]s passed &quot;The Law of the Restoration of the Civil Service&quot; which forced all Jewish university professors out of their jobs, and throughout the 1930s a campaign to label Einstein's work as &quot;Jewish physics&quot;&amp;mdash;in contrast with &quot;German&quot; or &quot;Aryan physics&quot;&amp;mdash;was led by Nobel laureates [[Philipp Lenard]] and [[Johannes Stark]]. With the assistance of the [[SS]], the ''[[Deutsche Physik]]'' supporters worked to publish pamplets and textbooks denigrating Einstein's theories and attempted to politically [[blacklist]] German physicists who taught them, notably [[Werner Heisenberg]]. Einstein renounced his German citizenship and stayed in the [[United States]], where he was given permanent residency. He accepted a position at the newly founded [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton Township, New Jersey|Princeton Township]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in 1940, though he still retained Swiss citizenship.

In 1939, under the encouragement of Szilárd, Einstein [[Einstein-Szilárd letter|sent a letter]] to President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] urging the study of [[nuclear fission]] for military purposes, under fears that the Nazi government would be first to develop [[atomic weapon]]s. 
Roosevelt started a small investigation into the matter which eventually became the massive [[Manhattan Project]]. Einstein himself did not work on the bomb project, however.

The [[International Rescue Committee]] was founded 1933 at the request of Albert Einstein to assist opponents of Adolf Hitler.

For more information, see the section below on Einstein's [[#Political views|political views]].

====Institute for Advanced Study====
His work at the Institute for Advanced Study focused on the unification of the [[physical law|laws of physics]], which he referred to as the ''Unified Field Theory''. He attempted to construct a model which would describe all of the [[fundamental forces]] as different manifestations of a single force. This took the form of an attempt to unify the gravitational and electrodynamic forces. His attempt was hindered because the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s were not understood independently until around 1970, fifteen years after Einstein's death. Einstein's goal of unifying the laws of physics under a single model survives in the current drive for [[Grand unification theory|unification of the forces]], embodied most notably by [[string theory]].

====Generalized theory==== 
Einstein began to form a [[generalized theory of gravitation]] with the Universal Law of Gravitation and the electromagnetic force in his first attempt to demonstrate the unification and simplification of the fundamental forces. In 1950 he described his work in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article.  Einstein was guided by a belief in a single statistical measure of variance for the entire set of physical laws. 

Einstein's Generalized Theory of Gravitation is a universal mathematical approach to field theory. He investigated reducing the different phenomena by the process of logic to something already known or evident. Einstein tried to unify gravity and electromagnetism in a way that also led to a new subtle understanding of quantum mechanics.

Einstein postulated a four-dimensional space-time continuum expressed in axioms represented by five component vectors.  Particles appear in his research as a limited region in space in which the field strength or the energy density are particularly high. Einstein treated subatomic particles as objects embedded in the unified field, influencing it and existing as an essential constituent of the unified field but not of it. Einstein also investigated a natural generalization of symmetrical tensor fields, treating the combination of two parts of the field as being a natural procedure of the total field and not the symmetrical and antisymmetrical parts separately. He researched a way to delineate the equations and systems to be derived from a [[variational principle]].

Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research on a generalised theory of gravitation and was ultimately unsuccessful in his attempts.  In particular, his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces ignored work in the physics community at large, most notably the discovery of the [[strong nuclear force]] and [[weak nuclear force]].

===Final years===
In 1948, Einstein served on the original committee which resulted in the founding of [[Brandeis University]]. A portrait of Einstein was taken by [[Yousuf Karsh]] on [[February 11]] of that same year. In 1952, the [[Israel]]i government proposed to Einstein that he take the post of second president. He declined the offer, and remains the only United States citizen ever to be offered a position as a foreign head of state. On [[March 30]], [[1953]], Einstein released a revised unified [[Field (physics)|field theory]].

He died at 1:15 AM[http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/ein.html] in Princeton hospital[http://www.princetonhistory.org/museum_alberteinstein.cfm] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], on [[April 18]], [[1955]] at the age of 76 from internal bleeding, which was caused by the rupture of an [[aortic aneurism]], leaving the Generalized Theory of Gravitation unsolved.  The only person present at his deathbed, a hospital nurse, said that just before his death he mumbled several words in [[German language|German]] that she did not understand. He was [[cremation|cremated]] without ceremony on the same day he died at [[Trenton, New Jersey]], in accordance with his wishes. His ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location. 

An autopsy was performed on Einstein by Dr. [[Thomas Stoltz Harvey]], who removed and preserved [[Albert Einstein's brain|his brain]]. Harvey found nothing unusual with his brain, but in 1999 further analysis by a team at [[McMaster University]] revealed that his parietal [[Operculum (brain)|operculum]] region was missing and, to compensate, his inferior [[parietal lobe]] was 15% wider than normal.{{rf|12|news.bbc.co.uk.381}} The inferior parietal region is responsible for mathematical thought, visuospatial cognition, and imagery of movement. Einstein's brain also contained 73% more [[glial cells]] than the average brain.

==Personality==
Albert Einstein was much respected for his kind and friendly demeanor rooted in his [[pacifism]].  He was modest about his abilities, and had distinctive attitudes and fashions—for example, he minimized his wardrobe so that he would not need to waste time in deciding on what to wear. He was captivatingly simple, wearing mothy sweaters and sweatshirts and sans socks in his old age. He occasionally had a playful sense of humor, and enjoyed [[sailing]] and playing the [[violin]].  He was also the stereotypical bumbling &quot;[[absent-minded professor]]&quot;; he was often forgetful of everyday items, such as keys, and would focus so intently on solving physics problems that he would often become oblivious to his surroundings. In his later years, his appearance inadvertently created (or reflected) another stereotype of scientist in the process: the researcher with unruly white hair. 

===Religious views===
Although he was raised [[Jewish]], he was not a believer in the religious aspect of [[Judaism]], though he still considered himself a Jew. He simply admired the beauty of nature and the universe.  From a letter written in [[English language|English]], dated [[March 24]], [[1954]], Einstein wrote, ''&quot;It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.  If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.&quot;''

He also said (in an essay reprinted in ''Living Philosophies'', vol. 13, 1931): ''&quot;A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds—it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity; in this sense, and this [sense] alone, I am a deeply religious man.&quot;''

The following is a response made to [[Rabbi Herbert Goldstein]] of the [[International Synagogue]] in [[New York City|New York]] which read, ''&quot;I believe in [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's God]] who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings.&quot;'' After being pressed on his religious views by [[Martin Buber]], Einstein exclaimed, ''&quot;What we [physicists] strive for is just to draw His lines after Him.&quot;'' He also quoted once ''&quot;When I read the [[Bhagavad Gita]], I ask myself how God created the universe. Everything else seems superfluous.&quot;'' Summarizing his religious beliefs, he once said: ''&quot;My [[religion]] consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind.&quot;''

Einstein was an Honorary Associate of the [[Rationalist Press Association]] beginning in 1934, and was an admirer of [[Ethical Culture]].{{rf|13|ethicalculture.1}}

===Political views===
[[Image:Mikhoels and Einstein 1943.jpg|thumb|right|222px|Einstein and [[Solomon Mikhoels]], the chairman of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]], in 1943.]]

Einstein considered himself a [[pacifism|pacifist]]{{rf|14|www.amnh.org.382}} and [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]],{{rf|15|www.amnh.org.383}} and in later years, a committed democratic [[socialism|socialist]]. He once said, ''&quot;I believe [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi's]] views were the most enlightened of all the political men of our time.  We should strive to do things in his spirit: not to use violence for fighting for our cause, but by non-participation of anything you believe is evil.&quot;'' Einstein's views on other issues, including socialism, [[McCarthyism]] and [[racism]], were controversial. In a 1949 article entitled &quot;Why Socialism?&quot;,{{rf|16|socialism}} Albert Einstein described the &quot;predatory phase of human development&quot;, exemplified by a chaotic [[capitalism|capitalist]] society, as a source of evil to be overcome. He disapproved of the [[totalitarian]] regimes in the [[Soviet Union]] and elsewhere, and argued in favor of a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] system which would combine a [[planned economy]] with a deep respect for [[human rights]]. Einstein was a co-founder of the liberal [[German Democratic Party]] and a member of the [[AFL-CIO]]-affiliated union the [[American Federation of Teachers]].

Einstein was very much involved in the [[American Civil Rights Movement|Civil Rights movement]]. He was a close friend of [[Paul Robeson]] for over 20 years.  Einstein was a member of several civil rights groups (including the Princeton chapter of the [[NAACP]]) many of which were headed by Paul Robeson. He served as co-chair with [[Paul Robeson]] of the ''American Crusade to End Lynching''. When [[W.E.B. DuBois]] was frivolously charged with being a communist spy during the McCarthy era while he was in his 80s, Einstein volunteered as a character witness in the case. The case was dismissed shortly after it was announced that he was to appear in that capacity. Einstein was quoted as saying that &quot;racism is America's greatest disease&quot;. 

The U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein ''&quot;believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy (word)|anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'&quot;'', among other charges. They also alleged that Einstein ''&quot;was a member, sponsor, or affiliated with thirty-four [[communism|communist]] fronts between 1937-1954&quot;'' and ''&quot;also served as honorary chairman for three communist organizations&quot;''.{{rf|17|foia.fbi.gov.384}} It should be noted that many of the documents in the file were submitted to the FBI, mainly by civilian political groups, and not actually written by FBI officials.

[[Image:EinsteinSzilard.jpg|thumb|left|222px|In 1939, Einstein signed a letter, written by [[Leó Szilárd]], to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] arguing that the United States should start funding research into the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s.]]

Einstein opposed tyrannical forms of government, and for this reason (and his Jewish background), opposed the Nazi regime and fled Germany shortly after it came to power. At the same time, Einstein's [[libertarian socialism|anarchist]] nephew [[Carl Einstein]], who shared many of his views, was fighting the fascists in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and even sent a letter{{rf|18|hypertextbook.com.385}} to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] (dated [[August 2]], [[1939]], before [[World War II]] broke out, and probably written by [[Leó Szilárd]]) encouraging him to initiate a program to create a nuclear weapon. Roosevelt responded to this by setting up a committee for the investigation of using [[uranium]] as a weapon, which in a few years was superseded by the [[Manhattan Project]].  

After the war, though, Einstein lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]]: &quot;I do not know how the Third World War will be fought, but I can tell you what they will use in the Fourth—rocks!&quot;{{rf|19|calaprice173}}

Einstein was a supporter of [[Zionism]]. He supported Jewish settlement of the ancient seat of Judaism and was active in the establishment of the [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]], which published (1930) a volume titled ''About Zionism: Speeches and Lectures by Professor Albert Einstein'', and to which Einstein bequeathed his papers.  However, he opposed nationalism and expressed skepticism about whether a Jewish nation-state was the best solution.  He may have imagined Jews and Arabs living peacefully in the same land.  In later life, in 1952, he was offered the post of second president of the newly created state of [[Israel]], but declined the offer, claiming that he lacked the necessary people skills. Einstein was disturbed by the violence taking place in the Palestine after the Second World War and expressed that he was disappointed with the Jewish Ultra-Nationalist Organization ([[Irgun]] and Stern Gang). Nonetheless, Einstein remained deeply committed to the welfare of Israel and the Jewish people for the rest of his life.  

Einstein, along with [[Albert Schweitzer]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], fought against nuclear tests and bombs. As his last public act, and just days before his death, he signed the [[Russell-Einstein Manifesto]], which led to the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]]. His letter to Russell read:

:Dear Bertrand Russell,

::Thank you for your letter of April&amp;nbsp;5. I am gladly willing to sign your excellent statement. I also agree with your choice of the prospective signers.

:With kind regards, A. Einstein

==Nationality: German, Swiss or American?==
Einstein was born a [[Germany|German]] citizen. At the age of seventeen, on [[January 28]], [[1896]], he was released from the German citizenship by his own request and with the approval of his father. He remained [[stateless person|stateless]] for five years.  On [[February 21]], [[1901]] he gained [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizenship, which he never revoked.  Einstein regained German citizenship in [[1914#January-April|April 1914]] when he entered German civil service, but due to the political situation and the persecution of Jewish people in [[Nazi Germany]], he left civil service in [[1933#March|March 1933]] and thus also lost the German citizenship.  On [[1940#September-October|October 1, 1940]], Einstein became an [[United States citizen|American citizen]]. He remained both an American and a Swiss citizen until his death on [[1955#April|April 18, 1955]].

==Popularity and cultural impact==
Einstein's popularity has led to widespread use of Einstein in [[advertising]] and [[merchandising]], including the registration of &quot;Albert Einstein&quot; as a [[trademark]]. 

[[Image:Einstongue.jpg|thumb|right|222px|The photo (detail from the original) of this humorous expression was taken during Einstein's [[birthday]] on [[March 14]], [[1951]], [[United Press International|UPI]].]]

===Entertainment===
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, [[film]]s and plays, including [[Jean-Claude Carrier]]'s 2005 French novel, Einstein S'il Vous Plait (Please Mr Einstein), [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film ''[[Insignificance (film)|Insignificance]]'', [[Fred Schepisi]]'s film ''[[I.Q. (film)|I.Q.]]'', [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel ''Einstein's Dreams'', and [[Steve Martin]]'s comedic play &quot;[[Picasso at the Lapin Agile]]&quot;.  He was the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 [[opera]] ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]''.  His humorous side is also the subject of [[Ed Metzger]]'s one-man play ''[[Albert Einstein: The Practical Bohemian]]''.

He is often used as a model for depictions of [[mad scientists|eccentric scientist]]s in works of fiction; his own character and distinctive hairstyle suggest eccentricity, or even lunacy and are widely copied or exaggerated. [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] magazine writer Frederic Golden referred to Einstein as &quot;a cartoonist's dream come true.&quot;

On Einstein's 72nd birthday in 1951, the [[UPI]] photographer Arthur Sasse was trying to coax him into smiling for the camera. Having done this for the photographer many times that day, Einstein stuck out his tongue instead.{{rf|20|www.mentalfloss.com.386}} The image has become an icon in pop culture for its contrast of the genius scientist displaying a moment of levity. [[Yahoo Serious]], an Australian film maker, used the photo as an inspiration for the intentionally anachronistic movie ''[[Young Einstein]]''.

===Licensing===
Einstein bequeathed his estate, as well as the use of his image (see [[personality rights]]), to the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].{{rf|21|aip.org.387}} Einstein actively supported the university during his life and this support continues with the [[royalties]] received from licensing activities. [[The Roger Richman Agency]] [[licence|licences]] the commercial use of the name &quot;Albert Einstein&quot; and associated imagery and likenesses of Einstein, as [[agent (law)|agent]] for the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. As head licensee the agency can control commercial usage of Einstein's name which does not comply with certain standards (e.g., when Einstein's name is used as a [[trademark]], the ™ symbol must be used){{rf|22|refbot.388}}. As of May, 2005, the Roger Richman Agency was acquired by [[Corbis]].

===Honors===

{{ent|9|Thorne}} [[David Hilbert]] actually published the field equation in an article dated five days before Einstein's lecture. But according to Thorne (pp. 117&amp;ndash;118), Hilbert had discovered the correct derivation after &quot;mulling over things he had learned&quot; on a recent visit by Einstein to Gottingen. However Thorne goes on to say &quot;Quite naturally, and in accord with Hilbert's view of things, the resulting law of warpage was quickly given the name the ''Einstein field equation'' rather than being named after Hilbert. Hilbert had carried out the last few mathematical steps to its discovery independently and almost simultaneously with Einstein, but Einstein was responsible for essentially everything that preceded those steps: the recognition that tidal gravity must be the same thing as a warpage of spacetime, the vision that the law of warpage must obey the reativity principle, and the first 90 percent of that law, the Einstein field equation. In fact without Einstein the general relativistic laws of gravity might not have been discovered until several decades later.&quot;  See [[Priority disputes about Einstein and the relativity theories]] for more details.

'''Afghanistan''' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]/[[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari-Persian]]: افغانستان, Afğānistān) is a [[landlocked]] country at the crossroads of [[Asia]]. Generally considered a part of [[Central Asia]], it is sometimes ascribed to a regional bloc in either [[South Asia]] or the [[Middle East]], as it has cultural, ethno-linguistic, and geographic links with most of its neighbors. It is bordered by [[Iran]] in the west, [[Pakistan]] in the south and east, [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]] in the north, and [[People's Republic of China|China]] to the east. It has a population of 30 million people, although this remains an estimate, as no official census has been taken for decades.

Afghanistan literally translates to 'land of the [[Afghan people|Afghans]]', but a plethora of other names have been applied to its general location in the past. Between the fall of the [[Taliban]] after the [[U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] and the [[2003 Loya jirga]], Afghanistan was referred to by the Government of the United States as the ''Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan''. Under its new [[Constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]], the country is now officially named the '''[[Islamic republic|Islamic Republic]] of Afghanistan'''.

&lt;!-- Orphaned information:
Population of Kabul: 1,424,400 (1988)
Land borders: 5,529 km
Coastline: Landlocked
[[National Day]]: [[18 August]]
Religions: Sunni 84%, Shi'a 15%
1 Afghani = 100 [[pul]]s
--&gt;
==Origin and history of the name==
The name of '''Afghanistan''' derives from  word ''[[Afghan people|Afghan]]''. The [[Pushtun]]s appear to have begun using the term Afghan as a name for themselves from the [[Islam |Islamic]] period onwards. According to W.K. Frazier Tyler, M.C. Gillet and several other scholars, ''&quot;The word  Afghan first appears in history in the [[Hudud ul-'alam min al-mashriq ila al-maghrib|Hudud-al-Alam]] in 982 AD.&quot;''

There are numerous views, regarding the origin of name Afghan, most of them being purely speculative as can be seen below:

Makhzan-i-Afghni by Nematullah written in 1612 CE, traces the Afghan or Pakhtun origin from the super-Patriarch [[Abraham]] down to one named King Talut or [[Saul]]. It states that Saul had a son Irmia (Jeremia), who had a son called Afghana. Upon the death of King Saul, Afghana was raised by David, and was later promoted to the chief command of the army during the reign of King [[Solomon]]. The progeny of this Afghana multiplied numerously, and came to be called ''Bani-Israel''. In the sixth century BCE, Bakhtunnasar, or [[Nebuchadnezzar]] king of [[Babul]], attacked [[Judah]] and exiled the progeny of Afghana to Ghor located in the center of what is now  Afghanistan. In course of time, the exiled community came to be addressed as ''Afghan'' after the name of their ancestor, and the country got its name as Afghanistan. This traditional view has many historical discrepancies, and is therefore not accepted by modern scholarship---the last pleader for the ''Bani-Israel'' hypothesis being Mayor Raverty (The Pathans, 1958, Olaf Caroe). 

Another version of Pushtun legend places Afghana, the professed eponymous ancestor of the Afghans or [[Pushtun]]s, as a contemporary of Muslim [[Prophet Mohammad]]. On hearing about the new faith of Islam, Qais from Aryana travelled to [[Medina]] to see the Muslim [[Muhammad |Prophet Muhammad]], and returned to Aryana as a Muslim. Qais Abdur Rashid purportedly had many sons, one of whom was Afghana. Afghana, in turn, had four sons who set out to the east to establish their separate lineages. The first son went to [[Swat]], the second to [[Lahore]] and [[India]], the third to [[Multan]], and the last one to [[Quetta]]. This legend is one of many traditional tales amongst the Pashtuns regarding their disparate origins. Again, it was this legendary Afghana who is stated to have given the  Pushtuns their current name. It is notable that the Afghan of this legend is separated from the Afghana of [[Solomon]]'s times by at least 11 centuries.
Dr H.W. Bellew, in his book  ''An Enquiry into the Ethnography of Afghanistan'', believes that the name ''Afghan'' derives from the [[Latin]] term ''Alban'', used by [[Armenians]] as ''Alvan'' or ''Alwan'', which refers to mountaineers, and in the case of transliterated Armenian characters, would be pronounced as ''[[Caucasian Albania|Aghvan]]'' or ''Aghwan''.  To the [[Persians]], this would further be altered to ''Aoghan'', ''Avghan'', and ''Afghan'' as a reference to the highlanders or &quot;mountaineers&quot; of the eastern [[Iranian plateau]]. 

Some people hold that the name derives from &quot;Abagan&quot;  (i.e without God) which term the  [[Persians]]  are stated to have coined for the [[Pushtun]]s to describe them as ''Godless or non-believers''. It is claimed that word ''Abagan'' is antonym of the word Bagan (=believer in God) just as word apolitical is [[antonym]] of  political in the English language. 

There are also a few people who link  &quot;Afghan&quot; to an [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] word &quot;''Avagan''&quot; said to mean &quot;original&quot;. Still others believe that the name derives from [[Sanskrit]]  ''upa-ganah'', said to mean &quot;allied tribes&quot;.  

Another etymological view is that the name ''Afghan'' evidently derives from  [[Sanskrit]] [[Ashvaka]] or [[Ashvakan]] (q.v),  the Assakenoi of [[Arrian]]. This view was propounded by J. W. McCrindle and is supported by numerous modern scholars (including C. Lassen, S. Martin, Bishop, Crooks, W. Crooke, J. C. Vidyalnar, M. R. Singh, P. Smith, N. L. Dey, Dr J. L. Kamboj, S. Kirpal Singh and several others).  In Sanskrit, word ''ashva'' ([[Iranian languages|Iranian]] ''aspa'', [[Prakrit]] ''assa'') means &quot;horse&quot;, and ''ashvaka'' (Prakrit ''assaka'') means &quot;horseman&quot;. Pre-Christian times knew the people of eastern Afghanistan as ''Ashvakas'' ([[cavalry |horsemen]]), since they raised a fine breed of horses and had a reputation for providing expert [[cavalrymen]]. The fifth-century-BCE [[India]]n grammarian [[Panini]] calls them ''Ashvayana'' and ''Ashvakayana''. Classical writers use the respective equivalents ''Aspasios'' (or Aspasii, Hippasii) and ''Assakenois'' (or Assaceni/Assacani, Asscenus). The Aspasios/Assakenois (= Ashvakas = cavalrymen) is stated to be another name for the [[Kambojas]] because of their [[equestrian]] characteristics  (see [[List of country name etymologies]]).

The last part of the name ''Afghanistan'' originates from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''st&amp;#257;n'' (''country'' or ''land''). The English word ''Afghanland'' that appeared in various treaties between [[Qajars|Qajar-Persia]] and the [[United Kingdom]] dealing with the Eastern lands of the Persian kingdom (modern Afghanistan) was adopted by the Afghans and became ''Afghanistan''.

Before being called 'Afghanistan', the region had gone through several name changes in its long history of around 5000 years. One of the most ancient names, according to historians and scholars, was ''Ariana'' - the Greek pronunciation of the ancient [[Avestan]] ''Aryanam Vaeja'' or the [[Sanskrit]] &quot;Aryavarta&quot;, ''Land of the [[Aryans]]''. Today this Old-Persian, and [[Avestan]] expression is preserved in the name ''[[Iran]]'' and it is noted in the name of the Afghan national airline, ''[[Ariana Airlines]]''. The term 'Ariana Afghanistan' is still popular amongst Persian speakers in the country.

Many centuries later, Afghanistan was part of [[Greater Khorasan]], and hence was recognized with the name [[Khorasan]] (along with regions centered around [[Merv]] and [[Neishabur]]), which in [[Pahlavi]] means &quot;The Eastern Land&quot; (خاور زمین in Persian). ''([[Dehkhoda]], p8457)''

==History==
{{main|History of Afghanistan}}

Afghanistan exists at a unique nexus-point where numerous Eurasian civilizations have interacted and often fought and was an important site of early historical activity. Through the ages, the region today known as ''Afghanistan'' has been invaded by a host of peoples, including the [[Indo-Iranians|Aryans]], [[Medes]], [[Achaemenids|Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryans]], [[Kushans]], [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanians]], [[Arabs]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[British]], and [[Soviets]], but rarely have these groups managed to exert complete control over the region. On other occasions, native Afghan entities have invaded surrounding regions to form empires of their own.

Between 2000 and 1200 [[Common Era|BCE]], waves of [[Indo-European]]-speaking [[Indo-Iranians|Aryans]] are thought to have flooded into modern-day Afghanistan, setting up a nation that became known as ''Aryānām Xšaθra'', or &quot;Land of the Aryans.&quot; [[Zoroastrianism]] is speculated to have possibly originated in Afghanistan between 1800 to 800 BCE. Ancient Eastern Iranian languages such as [[Avestan]] may have been spoken in Afghanistan around a similar time-line with the rise of Zoroastrianism. Around 1000 BCE (or earlier), the [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] [[Vedic]] civilization may have arisen near the vicinity of the [[Kabul]] valley of eastern Afghanistan, but this remains speculative as more viable theories based upon archaeological finds tend to support the emergence of the Vedic civilization east of the [[Indus]] and/or [[Ganges]] in what is today Pakistan and India. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the [[Achaemenids|Persian Empire]] supplanted the [[Medes]] and incorporated Aryana within its boundaries; and by 330 BCE, Alexander the Great had invaded the region. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the Hellenic successor states of the [[Seleucids]] and [[Bactrians]] controlled the area, while the [[Maurya]]ns from India annexed the southeast for a time and introduced [[Buddhism]] to the region until the area returned to the Bactrian rule.

During the 1st century [[Common Era|CE]], the [[Kushan]]s, a [[Tocharian]] people from Central Asia with Indo-European origins, occupied the region. Thereafter, Aryana fell to a number of Eurasian tribes &amp;mdash; including [[Parthians]], [[Scythians]], and [[Hepthalites|Huns]], as well as the [[Sassanian]] Persians and local rulers such as the [[Hindu]] [[Shahi]]s in Kabul &amp;mdash; until the 7th century CE, when Muslim [[Arab]] armies invaded the region.

The Arabs initially annexed parts of western Afghanistan in 652 and then conquered most of the rest of Afghanistan between 706-709 CE and administered the region as [[Khorasan]], and over time much of the local population converted to Islam, but retained their [[Iranian languages]]. Afghanistan became the center of various important empires, including the [[Ghaznavid Empire]] (962-1151), founded by a local [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ruler from [[Ghazni]] named [[Mahmud Ghaznavi|Yamin ul-Dawlah Mahmud]], that expanded its suzerainty over a vast area from [[Kurdistan]] to northern India. This empire was replaced by the Ghorid Empire (1151-1219), founded by another local ruler, this time of [[Tajik]] extraction, [[Muhammad Ghori]], whose domains included huge parts of Central and South Asia, and laid the foundations for the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in India.

In 1219, the region was overrun by the Mongols under [[Genghis Khan]], who devastated the land. Their rule continued with the [[Ilkhanate]]s, and was extended further following the invasion of [[Tamerlane]] (Timur Leng), a ruler from Central Asia. By 1400, all of Afghanistan came under his dominion, and he also laid the foundation of another Islamic empire in India, the [[Mughal Empire]]. The [[Uzbek]]-born [[Babur]], a descendant of both Tamerlane and Genghis Khan, established an empire with its capital at Kabul by 1504, and then expanded into South Asia in 1525 and established the Mughal Empire's rule throughout much of what is today Pakistan and northern India by 1527. As the empire shifted eastward, the [[Safavids]] of Persia challenged Mughal rule while the two superpower empires of the day battled over the fate of Afghanistan for decades with the Persians acquiring the area by the mid-17th century.

Local [[Ghilzai]] Pashtun tribesmen, lead by Khan Nashir, successfully overthrew Safavid rule, and under the [[Hotaki]] dynasty, briefly controlled all or parts of Persia itself from 1722 to 1736. Following a brief period under the rule (1736-1747) of the Turko-Iranian conqueror [[Nadir Shah]], one of his high-ranking military officers, [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali]], himself a Pashtun tribesman of the [[Durrani|Abdali]] clan, called for a ''loya jirga'' following Nadir Shah's assassination (for which many implicate Abdali) in 1747. The Afghans/Pashtuns came together at Kandahar in 1747 and chose Ahmad Shah, who changed his last name to Durrani (meaning 'pearl of pearls' in Persian), to be king. The Afghanistan nation-state as it is known today came into existence in 1747 as the [[Durrani Empire]], and expanded outward from traditional Pashtun territories to include all of what is today Afghanistan, a portion of [[Mashad]] in Iran, and all of Pakistan and Kashmir as well. The Durrani Empire lasted for nearly a century until internecine conflict and wars with the Persians and [[Sikhs]] diminished their empire by the early 19th century. However, the current borders of Afghanistan would not be determined until the coming of the British.

During the 19th century, following the [[Anglo-Afghan wars]] (fought in 1839-1842, 1878-1880, and lastly in 1919), Afghanistan saw much of its territory and autonomy ceded to the [[United Kingdom]]. The United Kingdom exercised a great deal of influence, and it was not until King [[Amanullah]] acceded to the throne in 1919 (see &quot;[[The Great Game]]&quot;) that Afghanistan regained complete independence. During the period of British intervention in Afghanistan, ethnic Pashtun territories were divided by the [[Durand Line]], and this would lead to strained relations between Afghanistan and [[British India]], and later the new state of Pakistan, over what came to be known as the [[Pashtunistan]] debate.

The historical rulers of Afghanistan were part of the Abdali tribe of the ethnic Afghans, whose name was changed to [[Durrani]] upon the accession of [[Ahmad Shah]]. They belonged to the Saddozay segment of the [[Popalzay]] clan, or to the Mohammadzay segment of the Barakzay clan, of the ethnic Afghans. The Mohammadzay frequently furnished the Sadozay kings with top counselors, who served occasionally as regents, and identified with the name Mohammadzay.

Since 1900, eleven monarchs and rulers have been unseated through undemocratic means: in 1919 (assassination), 1929 (abdication), 1929 (execution), 1933 (assassination), 1973 (deposition), 1978 (execution), 1979 (execution), 1979 (execution), 1987 (removal), 1992 (overthrow), 1996 (overthrow) and 2001 (overthrow).

The longest period of stability in Afghanistan was between 1933 and 1973, when the country was under the rule of King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]]. However, in 1973, Zahir's brother-in-law, [[Sardar Mohammed Daoud]] launched a bloodless coup. Daoud and his entire family were murdered in 1978 when the [[communist]] [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] launched a coup known as the [[Khalq|Great Saur Revolution]] and took over the government.

Opposition against, and conflict within, the series of communist governments that followed, was considerable. As part of a [[Cold War]] strategy, the US government began to covertly fund and train anti-government [[Mujahideen]] forces through the Pakistani secret service agency known as Inter Services Intelligence or ISI, which were derived from discontented Muslims in the country who opposed the official atheism of the Marxist regime, in 1978. In order to bolster the local Communist forces the [[Soviet Union]] - citing the 1978 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries in 1978 - intervened on [[December 24]], 1979. The Soviet occupation resulted in a mass exodus of over 5 million Afghans who moved into refugee camps in neighboring Pakistan and Iran. More than 3 million alone settled in Pakistan. Faced with mounting international pressure and the loss of approximately 15,000 Soviet soldiers as a result of Mujahideen opposition forces trained by the [[United States]], Pakistan, and other foreign governments, the Soviets withdrew ten years later, in 1989. For more details, see [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]].

The Soviet withdrawal was seen as an ideological victory in the US, which ostensibly had backed the Mujahideen in order to counter Soviet influence in the vicinity of the oil-rich [[Persian Gulf]]. Following the removal of the Soviet forces in 1989, the US and its allies lost interest in Afghanistan and did little to help rebuild the war-ravaged country. The USSR continued to support the regime of Dr. Najubullah (formerly the head of the secret service, Khad) until its downfall in 1992. However, the absence of the Soviet forces resulted in the downfall of the government as it steadily lost ground to the guerrilla forces. [http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0856490.html]

As the vast majority of the elites and intellectuals had either been systematically eliminated by the Communists, or escaped to take refuge abroad, a dangerous leadership vacuum came into existence. Fighting continued among the various Mujahidin factions, eventually giving rise to a state of [[warlordism]]. The chaos and corruption that dominated post-Soviet Afghanistan in turn spawned the rise of the [[Taliban]] in response to the growing chaos. The most serious fighting during this growing civil conflict occurred in 1994, when 10,000 people were killed during factional fighting in Kabul.

Exploiting the chaotic situation in Afghanistan, a few regional bedfellows including fundamentalist Afghans trained in refugee camps in western Pakistan, the Pakistani secret intelligence service (ISI), the regional Mafia (well-established network that smuggled mainly Japanese electronics and tyres before the Russian invasion, now involved in drug smuggling) and Arab extremist groups (that were looking for a safe operational hub) joined forces and helped to create the [[Taliban]] movement (Rashid 2000).[http://www.ahmedrashid.com/] Backed by Pakistan, [[Saudi Arabia]] and other strategic allies, the Taliban developed as a politico-religious force, and eventually seized power in 1996. The Taliban were able to capture 90% of the country, aside from the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]] strongholds primarily found in the northeast in the [[Panjshir Valley]]. The Taliban sought to impose a strict interpretation of [[Islam]]ic ''[[Sharia]]'' law and gave safe haven and assistance to individuals and organizations that were implicated as terrorists, most notably [[Osama bin Laden]]'s [[Al-Qaeda]] network.

The United States and allied military action in support of the opposition following the [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks]] forced the Taliban's downfall. In late 2001, major leaders from the Afghan opposition groups and diaspora met in [[Bonn]], and agreed on a [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|plan]] for the formulation of a new government structure that resulted in the inauguration of [[Hamid Karzai]] as Chairman of the [[Afghan Interim Authority]] (AIA) on December 2001. After a nationwide ''[[Loya Jirga]]'' in 2002, Karzai was elected President.

On [[March 3]] and [[March 25]] [[2002]], a series of earthquakes struck Afghanistan, with a loss of thousands of homes and over 1800 lives. Over 4000 more people were injured. The earthquakes occurred at Samangan Province ([[March 3]]) and Baghlan Province ([[March 25]]). The latter was the worse of the two, and caused most of the casualties. International authorities assisted the Afghan government in dealing with the situation.

As the country continues to rebuild and recover, as of late 2005, it was still struggling against widespread poverty, continued warlordism, a virtually non-existent infrastructure, possibly the largest concentration of land mines on earth and other unexploded ordinance, as well as a sizable illegal poppy and heroin trade.  Afghanistan also remains subject to occasionally violent political jockeying, and the nation's first elections were successfully held in 2004 as women parliamentarians were selected in record numbers. Parliamentary elections in 2005 helped to further stabilize the country politically, in spite of the numerous problems it faced, including inadequate international assistance. The country continues to grapple with occasional acts of violence from a few remaining [[al-Qaeda]] and [[Taliban]] and the instability caused by warlords.

==Politics==
''Main article: [[Politics of Afghanistan]]''

Afghanistan is currently led by president [[Hamid Karzai]], who was elected in October of 2004. Before the election, Karzai led the country after having been hand-picked by the administration of [[United States]]' [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] to head an interim government, after the fall of the Taliban. His current cabinet includes members of the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]], and a mix from other regional and ethnic groups formed from the transitional government by the [[Loya jirga]] (grand council). Former [[monarch]] [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] returned to the country, but was not reinstated as king, and only exercises limited ceremonial powers.

Under the [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|Bonn Agreement]] the [[Afghan Constitution Commission]] was established to consult with the public and formulate a draft constitution. The meeting of a constitutional ''loya jirga'' was held in December 2003, when a new constitution was adopted creating a presidential form of government with a bicameral legislature.

Troops and [[intelligence agencies]] from the United States and a number of other countries are present, some to keep the peace, others assigned to hunt for remnants of the [[Taliban]] and [[al Qaeda]]. A [[United Nations]] peacekeeping force called the [[International Security Assistance Force]] has been operating in Kabul since December 2001. [[NATO]] took control of this Force on [[August 11]], [[2003]]. Some of the country remains under the control of warlords. [http://www.newstatesman.com/200502070006]

On [[March 27]], [[2003]], Afghan deputy defense minister and powerful warlord General [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] created an office for the [[North Zone of Afghanistan]] and appointed officials to it, defying then-interim president [[Hamid Karzai]]'s orders that there be no zones in Afghanistan.

[[Eurocorps]] took over the responsibility for the NATO-led [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] in Kabul [[August 9]], [[2004]].

[[Afghan presidential election, 2004|National elections]] were held on [[October 9]], [[2004]]. Over 10 million Afghans were registered to vote. Most of the 17 candidates opposing Karzai [[boycott]]ed the election, charging fraud; [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1354517,00.html] an independent commission found evidence of fraud, but ruled that it did not affect the outcome of the poll. Karzai won 55.4% of the vote. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3977677.stm] He was inaugurated as president on [[December 7]]. It was the country's first national election since 1969, when parliamentary elections were last held.

On [[September 18]] [[2005]], [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2005|parliamentary elections]] were held; the [[Wolesi Jirga|parliament]] opened on the following [[December 19]].
On [[December 20]] Karzai's close ally and president of the first [[mujahideen]] government, [[Sibghatullah Mojadeddi]], was picked to head the 102-seat upper house.
On [[December 21]], [[Yunus Qanuni]], Afghan opposition leader and Karzai's main opponent was chosen to lead the 249-seat lower house of parliament with 122 votes against 117 for his closest challenger.

==Geography==
[[Image:Afghanistan map.png|framed|Map of Afghanistan]]
''Main article: [[Geography of Afghanistan]]''

Afghanistan is a land-locked [[mountain]]ous country, with plains in the north and southwest. The highest point, at 7485 m (24,557 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above sea level, is [[Nowshak]]. Large parts of the country are dry, and fresh water supplies are limited. Afghanistan has a continental climate, with hot summers and cold winters. The country is frequently subject to [[earthquake]]s.

The major cities of Afghanistan are its capital Kabul, [[Herat]], [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan|Jalalabad]], [[Mazar-e Sharif]] and [[Kandahar]].

==Economy==
''Main article: [[Economy of Afghanistan]]''

Afghanistan is an extremely impoverished country, being one of the world's poorest and least developed countries. Two-thirds of the population lives on less than US$2 a day. The economy has suffered greatly from the recent political and military unrest since the 1979-80 Soviet invasion and subsequent conflicts, while severe drought added to the nation's difficulties in 1998-2001.

About 70 percent of the population is under 30 according to Asian Development Bank. The total fertility rate is 6.8, the highest in South Asia (with a regional average at 3.3), but so are mortality rates. Infant mortality rate is 166 per 1000 births. The economically active population in 2002 was about 11 million (out of a total of an estimated 29 million). While there are no official unemployment rate estimates available, it is evident that it is high. The number of non-skilled young people is estimated at 3 million, which is likely to increase by some 300,000 per annum. (Fujimura, 2004a). [http://www.adbi.org/research-policy-brief/2004/10/15/698.afghan.economy.after.election/]

The country's natural resources include copper, zinc and iron ore in central areas; precious and semi-precious stones such as lapis, emerald and azure in the north-east and east; and (unproved) oil and gas reserves in the north. However, &quot;its significant mineral resources remain largely untapped because of the Afghan War of the 1980s and subsequent fighting&quot; (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2005). A good portion of Afghanistan GDP comes from illicit drugs including opium, its derivtives morphine and heroin and hashish.


[[Image:President Celal Bayar, King Zahir and Lord Nasher.jpg|thumb|Afghanistan was once a world-renowned producer of cotton. Here Turkish President Celal Bayar and King Zahir inspect the produce of Khan Nasher's Spinzar Cotton Company in 1966]]

On a positive note, international efforts to rebuild Afghanistan led to the formation of the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) as a result of the December 2001 [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)| Bonn Agreement]], and later addressed at the Tokyo Donors Conference for Afghan Reconstruction in January 2002, where $4.5 billion was committed in a trust fund to be administered by the [[World Bank Group]]. Priority areas for reconstruction include the rebuilding of education system, health, and sanitation facilities, enhancement of administrative capacity, the development of the agricultural sector, and the rebuilding of road, energy, and telecommunication links.

According to a 2004 report by the Asian Development Bank, the present reconstruction effort is two-pronged: first it focuses on rebuilding critical physical infrastructure, and second, on building modern public sector institutions from the remnants of Soviet style planning to ones that promote market-led development (Fujimura, 2004b). But macroeconomic planning and management at present is hampered by poor information, weak service delivery systems, and less than adequate law enforcement.

The country has been going through economic recovery since the Taliban were overthrown in October 2001. However, estimating Afghanistan's economy is problematic as it is impossible to gather reliable statistics while it is going through a significant change period in all fronts, with the added problem of less than ideal security situation. The best estimate that can be relied upon is that of the Central Statistical Office in 2003, from which the CIA Factbook seems to have drawn some data. Accordingly, the country's estimated gross domestic product (GDP) was $21.5 billion in 2003, a 28.6% growth over 2002 (CIA Factbook 2003) [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html] 

Among the 232 listed countries in the CIA Factbook, Afghanistan ranks 108th in terms of GDP, which means per capita income of $800. A brief comparison shows that Afghanistan is the poorest country among its neighbors. Pakistan, with a GDP of $347 billion in 2003 had a per capita purchasing power of $2200 and Iran with its $517 billion had $7700. In the north, Turkmenistan had a GDP of $27.6 billion and a per capita income of $5700, Uzbekistan with its $48 billion had $1800, and Tajikistan despite a low GDP of only $8 billion had a per capita income of $1100 per head. The World Bank estimates that Afghanistan will remain in need of external financial help before it can stand on its own feet economically.

Ironically, Afghanistan's GDP ranks approximately at the same level as Jordan ($25.5bn) and Qatar ($19.5bn). However, considering that those oil-rich Arab states have smaller populations, Jordan per capita income amounts to $4500 and Qatar's to $23,200.

One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over two million refugees from neighbouring countries and the West, who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed capital to start up small businesses. What is also helping is the estimated $2-3 billion in international assistance, the partial recovery of the agricultural sector, and the reestablishment of market institutions. 

While the country's current account deficit is largely financed with the &quot;donor money&quot;, only a small portion - about 15% - is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the UN system and NGOs. It needs to be mentioned that there are some (as yet unconfirmed) claims that most of this money is spent on the expenses of the UN and other non-governmental organizations as well as being funneled into illegitimate activities.

The government had a central budget of only $350 million in 2003 and an estimated $550 million in 2004. The country's foreign exchange reserves totals about $500 million. Revenue is mostly generated through customs, as income and corporate tax bases are negligible. 

Inflation had been a major problem until 2002. However, the depreciation of the afghani in 2002 after the introduction of the new notes (which replaced 1,000 old afghani by 1 new afghani) coupled with the relative stability compared to previous periods has helped prices to stabilize and even decrease between December 2002 and February 2003, reflecting the turnaround appreciation of the new Afghani currency. Since then, the index has indicated stability, with a moderate increase toward late 2003 (Fujimura, 2004c).

The Afghan government and international donors seem to remain committed to improving access to basic necessities, infrastructure development, education, housing and economic reform. The central government is also focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. The rebuilding of the financial sector seems to have been so far successful. Money can now be transferred in and out of the country via official banking channels and according to accepted international norms. A new law on private investment provides 3-7 year tax holidays to eligible companies and a 4-year exemption from exports tariffs and duties.

While these improvements will help rebuild a strong basis for the nation in the future, for now, the majority of the population continues to suffer from insufficient food, clothing, housing, medical care, and other problems exacerbated by military operations and political uncertainties. The government is not strong enough to collect customs duties from all the provinces due to the power of the warlords. Fraud is widespread and “corruption is rife within all Afghan government organs, and central authority is barely felt in the lawless south and south-west” (The Economist, 2005). [http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4494134]

Expanding poppy cultivation and a growing opium trade is another huge problem for the country. The CIA estimates that one-third of the country's GDP comes from opium export, although the Asian Development Bank states a lower figure, namely $2.5 billion (12% of the GDP). At any rate, this is not only one of Kabul's most serious policy and law-enforcement challenges[http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html], but also one of the world's most serious problems. 

The problem began with the Soviet invasion in 1979-80. As the government began to lose control of provinces, &quot;warlordism&quot; flourished and with it opium production as regional commanders searched for ways to generate money to purchase weapons, according to the UN. [http://www.irinnews.org/webspecials/opium/Chronology.asp] (At this time the West was pursuing an &quot;arms-length&quot; supporting strategy of the Afghan freedom-fighters or Mujahidin, the main purpose being to cripple the USSR slowly into withdrawal rather than a quick and decisive overthrow).

When the West abandoned Afghanistan after its perceived victory over the Soviet Union as the Red Army was forced to withdraw in 1989, a power vacuum was created. Various Mujahidin factions started fighting against each other for power. With the discontinuation of Western support, they resorted ever more to poppy cultivation to finance their military existence.

The regional mafia, who were looking for a safe operational hub, joined forces with the more fanatic sections of the Mujahidin supported by Arab extremists like Osama bin Laden as well as the Pakistani secret intelligence service [[ISI]] to form the [[Taliban]] movement towards the end of 1994 (Rashid, 2000); [http://www.ahmedrashid.com/] see also BBC report here [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1569826.stm].

The Taliban, having taken control of 90% of the country, actively encouraged poppy cultivation. With this, they not only fulfilled their promises and obligations to their partners - the regional mafia - but also increased their own desperately needed income through taxes. According to the above UN source, Afghanistan saw a bumper opium crop of 4,600 million tonnes in 1999, which was the height of the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. When they came under extreme international diplomatic pressure in 2002, they initiated a ban on poppy cultivation.

Following the US-led coalition war that led to the defeat of the [[Taliban]] in November 2001 which essentially collapsed the economy, the relatively few other sources of revenue forced many of the country's farmers to resort back to growing cash crops for export. A notable example of such a crop is the [[opium poppy]] (1,300 km&amp;sup2; in 2004 according to the [[United Nations]] Office on Drugs and Crime), the cultivation of which has largely increased during the last decade: Afghanistan has become the first illicit opium producer in the world, before [[Burma]] ([[Myanmar]]), part of the so-called &quot;[[Golden Triangle]]&quot;. 

The main obstacle to eradicating poppy cultivation in Afghanistan is the US forces' need for the warlords and their forces in hunting terrorists. The warlords are the major culprits in poppy cultivation, but are also highly useful to the US forces in scouting, providing local intelligence, keeping their own territories clean from Al-Qaeda and Taliban insurgents, and even taking part in military operations - all for money. This also contributes to the lack of central government's real authority in provinces and discourages farmers from growing grain and fruit as they did for centuries previously.

In short, the Afghan economy is currently (December 2005) going through a hefty change period. On the one hand, there are encouraging signs of positive development and increasing wealth creation and management. But on the other hand, the security situation, the lingering war against terrorism and the opium problem have created tall barriers for Afghanistan to rejoin the international community in prosperity and economic development.

==Demographics==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Afghanistan]]''

The population of Afghanistan is divided into a wide variety of ethnic groups largely composed of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] and [[Turkic peoples]]. Because a systematic census has not been held in the country in decades, exact figures about the size and composition of the various ethnic groups are not available.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3717092.stm] Therefore most figures are approximations only. According to the CIA World FactBook (updated on [[17 May]] [[2005]]), an approximate ethnic group distribution is as follows:

[[Pashtun]] 30%, [[Tajiks|Tajik]] 29%,, [[Hazara]] 22%, [[Uzbek]] 11%, [[Aimak]] 5%, [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] 3%, [[Baloch]] 2%, other 4% including sikhs.[http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html#People]

The CIA factbook on languages in Afghanistan refers to the official languages of Afghanistan as being [[Persian language|Persian]] (local name: [[Dari]]) 50% and [[Pashtu]] 35%. Other languages include [[Turkic language]]s (primarily [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]) 11%, 30 minor languages (primarily [[Balochi]] and [[Pashai]]) 4%. Bilingualism is common.

Religiously, Afghans are overwhelmingly [[Muslim]] (approximately 80% [[Sunni]] and 19% [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]]). There are also small [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] minorities. Afghanistan was once home to a many-centuries-old [[Jew]]ish minority, numbering approximately 5,000 in 1948. Most Jewish families fled the country after the 1979 Soviet invasion, and only one individual remains today, [[Zablon Simintov]]. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39702-2005Jan26.html] With the fall of the Taliban a number of [[Sikhs]] have returned to the [[Ghazni]], [[Nangarhar]], [[Kandahar]] and [[Kabul]] Provinces of Afghanistan.

==Constitution==
''Main article: [[Constitution of Afghanistan]]''

According to the 2004 constitution, Afghanistan is run by a president, who is elected by direct popular vote to a five-year term. The president may only serve two terms. A candidate for president must be at least forty years of age, a Muslim, and a citizen of Afghanistan. The country has two vice-presidents. The president serves as head of state and government, and is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The president makes appointments for his cabinet, as well as posts in the military, police force, and provincial governorships, with the approval of parliament.

The legislative body of Afghanistan is a parliament consisting of two houses: the ''[[Wolesi Jirga]]'' (House of the People) and the ''[[Meshrano Jirga]]'' (House of Elders). The ''Wolesi Jirga'' consists of up to 250 members elected to five-year terms through direct elections in proportion to the population of each province. At least two women must be elected from each province. In the ''Meshrano Jirga'', one-third of the members are elected by provincial councils for four years, one-third are elected by district councils of each province for three years, an
